    "\n",
    "* Sometimes we want to move from specific words to higher-level categories in order to achieve **better classification or similarity results**\n",
    "    * Here, we can be pragmatic. What features produce the best results?\n",
    "    * This is an engineering problem\n",
    "    * But we may still care about explainability\n",
    "* Sometimes we move from words to concepts because we care about the **concepts themselves**\n",
    "    * In this case, explainability is really important\n",
    "    * We need to understand how our features capture (or fail to capture) the concepts we care about\n",
    "* And sometimes, we want to incorporate **paratextual features**, that is, features that are *about* a book, but aren't *in* the book, strictly speaking\n",
    "    * Author identity, gender, publication date, national origin, genre, market success, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today: look (a little bit) into non-unigram feature types that may help us in each of these cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "## There's more to life than token unigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most of our work so far has used counts of **token unigrams** (that is, individual words) to characterize texts\n",
    "* This is non-crazy!\n",
    "    * The words in a book tell us a lot about that book\n",
    "* But we often care less about words than we do about the classes of things those words represent\n",
    "    * Words are often just the most straightforward way to capture ideas, subject matter, types of action, chacaterization, etc.\n",
    "* There are additional ways to capture these higher-level concerns\n",
    "    * ***n*-grams** and **noun phrases** capture multi-word sequences like \"best friend\" and \"New York\"\n",
    "    * **Lemmatization** collapses specific word forms into a single root (\"running\" -> \"run\", \"cats\" -> \"cat\")\n",
    "    * **Part of speech** tagging collapses words into their linguistic functions (noun, verb, adjective, preposition, etc.)\n",
    "    * **Named entity recognition** identifies named entities (people, organizations, places, etc.)\n",
    "    * Several different approaches to identifying **subject matter**\n",
    "        * Topic models\n",
    "        * Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which we've already seen, in a different context, as SVD\n",
    "        * Coming up: word embeddings\n",
    "* Can think of **all** these methods as potential *dimension reduction* techniques: we use far more words than we have truly distinct concepts\n",
    "    \n",
    "## *n*-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***n*-grams** are sequences of some number of words that occur one after another in a text\n",
    "* '*n*' represents the number of consecutive words.\n",
    "    * *n*=1 is called a unigram. We've used these extensively already.\n",
    "    * *n*=2 is a bigram, 3=trigram, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a useful tool: [Google Books Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams). Also, [see a sample](https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=Great+War%2CWorld+War+I%2CWorld+War+II&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=27&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2CGreat+War%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CWorld+War+I%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CWorld+War+II%3B%2Cc0) that demonstrates an interesting historical issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, **be careful when considering historical use of words and phrases**. Consider semantic drift (changes in a word's meaning over time), orthographic issues like the (archaic) long 's', and the general sense in which published books do no represent all of a society in real time. But these are issues we always face! \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this, too. As ever, we can count sequences of words by hand. But `sklearn`'s vectorizers make it easy to add *n*-gram features:"

Born English, now a naturalized American, I am the hinge in our harmonious household of three: I sleep with both men, they each sleep only with me. We share everything else: home, finances, friends, vacations, life-threatening calamities. As Scott says, our tripod is more stable than a bipod.\"\"\",\n",

I’ll never forget the stars piercing the darkness and the shadowy outline of the towering mountains.
