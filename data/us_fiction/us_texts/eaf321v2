THE RAVEN and OTHER POEMS.
THE RAVEN.
Once
upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
'Tis some visiter, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door
Only this, and nothing more.
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is, and nothing more.
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
Sir, said I, or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard youhere I opened wide the
door;
Darkness there, and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,
fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
Lenore
!
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
Lenore
!
Merely this, and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.
Surely, said I, surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;
'Tis the wind and nothing more!
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed
he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, I said, art sure
no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly
shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian
shore!
Quoth the raven, Nevermore.
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as Nevermore.
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown
before
On the morrow
he
will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.
Then the bird said Nevermore.
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
Doubtless, said I, what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of `Nevernevermore,'
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and
door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of
yore
Meant in croaking Nevermore.
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen
censer
Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
Wretch, I cried, thy God hath lent theeby these angels he
hath sent thee
Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
Quoth the raven, Nevermore.
Prophet! said I, thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or
devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here
ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror hauntedtell me truly, I implore
Is there
is
there balm in Gilead?tell metell me, I implore!
Quoth the raven, Nevermore.
Prophet! said I, thing of evilprophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above usby that God we both
adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.
Quoth the raven, Nevermore.
Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend! I shrieked,
upstarting
Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
door!
Quoth the raven, Nevermore.
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be liftednevermore!
THE VALLEY OF UNREST.
Once
it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay.
Now
each visiter shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.
BRIDAL BALLAD.
The
ring is on my hand,
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satins and jewels grand
Are all at my command,
And I am happy now.
And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed
his
who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.
But he spoke to re-assure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the church-yard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
Oh, I am happy now!
And thus the words were spoken,
And this the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Behold the golden token
That proves me happy now!
Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how,
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken,
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.
THE SLEEPER:
At
midnight, in the month of June,
I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
Upon the quiet mountain top,
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take,
And would not, for the world, awake.
All Beauty sleeps!and lo! where lies
(Her casement open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinies!
Oh, lady bright! can it be right
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice drop
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfullyso fearfully
Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all solemn silentness!
The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
Forever with unopened eye,
While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!
My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep!
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And winged pannels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
Of her grand family funerals
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portal she hath thrown,
In childhood, many an idle stone
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne'er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within.
THE COLISEUM.
Type
of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power!
At lengthat lengthafter so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!
Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
I feel ye nowI feel ye in your strength
O spells more sure than e'er Judan king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!
Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
Lit by the wanlight of the hornd moon,
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!
But stay! these wallsthese ivy-clad arcades
These mouldering plinthsthese sad and blackened shafts
These vague entablaturesthis crumbling frieze
These shattered cornicesthis wreckthis ruin
These stonesalas! these gray stonesare they all
All of the famed, and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?
Not allthe Echoes answer menot all!
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
We rule the hearts of mightiest menwe rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds.
We are not impotentwe pallid stones.
Not all our power is gonenot all our fame
Not all the magic of our high renown
Not all the wonder that encircles us
Not all the mysteries that in us lie
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment,
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.
LENORE.
Ah,
broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
Let the bell toll!a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
And, Guy De Vere, hast
thou
no tear?weep now or never
more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be readthe funeral song be sung!
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her
pride,
And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed herthat she
died!
How
shall
the ritual, then, be read?the requiem how be sung
By youby yours, the evil eye,by yours, the slanderous
tongue
That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?
Peccavimus;
but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
The sweet Lenore hath gone before, with Hope, that flew
beside,
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
bride
For her, the fair and
debonair,
that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
The life still there, upon her hairthe death upon her eyes.
Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
But waft the angel on her flight with a Pan of old days!
Let
no
bell toll!lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
Should catch the note, as it doth floatup from the damnd
Earth.
To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is
riven
From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven
From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of
Heaven.
CATHOLIC HYMN.
At
mornat noonat twilight dim
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and woin good and ill
Mother of God, be with me still!
When the Hours flew brightly by,
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
Darkly my Present and my Past,
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
ISRAFEL.
1
1.
And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the
sweetest voice of all God's creatures.
Koran
.
In
Heaven a spirit doth dwell
Whose heart-strings are a lute;
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy stars (so legends tell)
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
Of his voice, all mute.
Tottering above
In her highest noon,
The enamoured moon
Blushes with love,
While, to listen, the red levin
(With the rapid Pleiads, even,
Which were seven,)
Pauses in Heaven.
And they say (the starry choir
And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.
3
But the skies that angel trod,
Where deep thoughts are a duty
Where Love's a grown up God
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star.
Therefore, thou art not wrong,
Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live, and long!
The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
With the fervour of thy lute
Well may the stars be mute!
Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merelyflowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours.
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky.
DREAM-LAND.
By
a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named
Night
,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of Spaceout of Time.
Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waterslone and dead,
Their still watersstill and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.
By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,
By the mountainsnear the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,
By the grey woods,by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp,
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls,
By each spot the most unholy
In each nook most melancholy,
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by
White-robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earthand Heaven.
For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tisoh 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May notdare not openly view it;
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
SONNET-TO ZANTE.
Where an Eidolon, named
Night
,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule.
Fair
isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
How many thoughts of what entombd hopes!
How many visions of a maiden that is
No moreno more upon thy verdant slopes!
No more!
alas, that magical sad sound
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more
Thy memory
no more!
Accursd ground
Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!
THE CITY IN THE SEA.
Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free
Up domesup spiresup kingly halls
Up fanesup Babylon-like walls
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathd friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.
But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wavethere is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow
The hours are breathing faint and low
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence.
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.
TO ONE IN PARADISE.
Thou
wast all that to me, love,
For which my soul did pine
A green isle in the sea, love,
A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.
Ah, dream too bright to last!
Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
A voice from out the Future cries,
On! on!but o'er the Past
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!
For, alas! alas! with me
The light of Life is o'er!
No moreno moreno more
(Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!
And all my days are trances,
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
And where thy footstep gleams
In what ethereal dances,
By what eternal streams.
EULALIE-A SONG.
I dwelt alone
In a world of moan,
And my soul was a stagnant tide,
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride
Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.
Ah, lessless bright
The starts of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
And never a flake
That the vapour can make
With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl
Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and
careless curl.
Now Doubtnow Pain
Come never again,
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
And all day long
Shines, bright and strong,
Astart within the sky,
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.
TO Fs S. Od.
Thou
wouldst be loved?then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not!
Being everything which now thou art,
Be nothing which thou art not.
So with the world thy gentle ways,
Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
Shall be an endless theme of praise,
And lovea simple duty.
TO F.
Beloved
! amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path
(Drear path, alas! where grows
Not even one lonely rose)
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee, and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose.
And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted far-off isle
In some tumultuous sea
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With stormsbut where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just o'er that one bright island smile.
SONNETSILENCE.
There
are some qualitiessome incorporate things,
That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a two-fold
Silence
sea and shore
Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's No More.
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!
THE CONQUEROR WORM
Lo! 'tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.
Mimes, in the form of God on high,
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro,
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Wo!
That motley dramaoh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased for evermore,
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
And Horror the soul of the plot.
But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes!it writhes!with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.
Outout are the lightsout all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, Man,
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
THE HAUNTED PALACE.
In
the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace
Radiant palacereared its head.
In the monarch Thought's dominion
It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair!
Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow,
(Thisall thiswas in the olden
Time long ago,)
And every gentle air that dallied,
In that sweet day,
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
A wingd odour went away.
Wanderers in that happy valley,
Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically,
To a lute's well-tund law,
Round about a throne where, sitting
(Porphyrogene!)
In state his glory well befitting,
The ruler of the realm was seen.
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
And sparkling evermore,
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.
But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
Assailed the monarch's high estate.
(Ah, let us mourn!for never sorrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed,
Is but a dim-remembered story
Of the old time entombed.
And travellers, now, within that valley,
Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms, that move fantastically
To a discordant melody,
While, like a ghastly rapid river,
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laughbut smile no more.
SCENES from POLITIAN;
AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.
I.
ROME.A Hall in a Palace. Alessandra and Castiglione.
Alessandra
.
Thou art sad, Castiglione.
Castiglione
.
Sad!not I.
Oh, I'm the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!
Aless
.
Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
Thy happiness!what ails thee, cousin of mine?
Why didst thou sigh so deeply?
Cas
.
Did I sigh?
I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
A sillya most silly fashion I have
When I am
very
happy. Did I sigh?
(
sighing

Aless
.
Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
Late hours and wine, Castiglione,these
Will ruin thee! thou art already altered
Thy looks are haggardnothing so wears away
The constitution as late hours and wine.
Cas
.
(
musing

Nothing, fair cousin, nothingnot even deep
sorrow
Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
I will amend.
Aless
.
Do it! I would have thee drop
Thy riotous company, toofellows low born
Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio's heir
And Alessandra's husband.
Cas
.
I will drop them.
Aless
.
Thou wiltthou must. Attend thou also more
To thy dress and equipagethey are over plain
For thy lofty rank and fashionmuch depends
Upon appearances.
Cas

I'll see to it.
Aless

Then see to it!pay more attention, sir,
To a becoming carriagemuch thou wantest
In dignity.

Much, much, oh much I want
In proper dignity.
Aless

(
haughtily
.)
Thou mockest me, sir!
Cas
.
(
abstractedly
.)
Sweet, gentle Lalage!
Aless
.
Heard I aright?
I speak to himhe speaks of Lalage!
Sir Count!
(
places her hand on his shoulder
)
what art thou
dreaming? he's not well!
What ails thee, sir?
Cas
.
(
starting
.)
Cousin! fair cousin!madam!
I crave thy pardonindeed I am not well
Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
This air is most oppressive!Madamthe Duke!
Enter Di Broglio
.
Di Broglio
.
My son, I've news for thee!hey?what's the
matter?
(
observing Alessandra
.)
I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
I've news for you both. Politian is expected
Hourly in RomePolitian, Earl of Leicester!
We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit
To the imperial city.
Aless
.
What! Politian
Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?
Di Broglio
.
The same, my love.
We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,
But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy
Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,
And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding.
Aless
.
I have heard much of this Politian.
Gay, volatile and giddyis he not?
And little given to thinking.
Di Broglio
.
Far from it, love.
No branch, they say, of all philosophy
So deep abstruse he has not mastered it,
Learned as few are learned.
Aless
.
'Tis very strange!
I have known men have seen Politian
And sought his company. They speak of him
As of one who entered madly into life,
Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.
Cas
.
Ridiculous! Now
I
have seen Politian
And know him wellnor learned nor mirthful he.
He is a dreamer and a man shut out
From common passions.
Di Broglio
.
Children, we disagree.
Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear
Politian was a
melancholy
man?

II.
ROME, A Lady's apartment, with a window open and looking into a
garden
.
Lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books
and a hand mirror. In the back ground Jacinta (a servant maid) leans
carelessly
upon a chair.
Lal
.
Jacinta! is it thou?
Jac
.
(
pertly
.)
Yes, Ma'am, I'm here.
Lal
.
I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.
Sit down!let not my presence trouble you
Sit down!for I am humble, most humble.
Jac
.
(
aside
.)
'Tis time.
(
Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the
chair, resting her elbows upon the back, and
regarding
her mistress with a contemptuous look. Lalage
continues to read
.
Lal
.
It in another climate, so he said,
Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil!
(
pausesturns over some leaves, and resumes
.)
No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower
But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.
Oh, beautiful!most beautiful!how like
To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
O happy land!
(
pauses
.)
She died!the maiden died!
O still more happy maiden who couldst die!
Jacinta!
(
Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes
.)
Again!a similar tale
Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play
She died full youngone Bossola answers him
I think not soher infelicity
Seemed to have years too manyAh luckless lady!
Jacinta!
(
still no answer
.)
Here's a far sterner story
But likeoh, very like in its despair
Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
A thousand heartslosing at length her own.
She died. Thus endeth the historyand her maids
Lean over her and weeptwo gentle maids
With gentle namesEiros and Charmion!
Rainbow and DoveJacinta!
Jac
.
(
pettishly
.)
Madam, what
is
it?
Lal
.
Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind
As go down in the library and bring me
The Holy Evangelists.
Jac
.
Pshaw!
(
exit
.)
Lal
.
If there be balm
For the wounded spirit in Gilead it is there!
Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
Will there be founddew sweeter far than that
Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.
(
re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table
.)
There, ma'am, 's the book. Indeed she is very troublesome.
(aside.)
Lal
.
(
astonished
.)
What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I
done aught
To grieve thee or to vex thee?I am sorry.
For thou hast served me long and ever been
Trust-worthy and respectful.
(
resumes her reading
.)
Jac
.
I can't believe
She has any more jewelsnonoshe gave me all.
(
aside
.)
Lal
.
What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me
Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
How fares good Ugo?and when is it to be?
Can I do aught?is there no farther aid
Thou needest, Jacinta?
Jac
.
Is there no
farther
aid!
That's meant for me.
(
aside
)
I'm sure, Madam, you need not
Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.
Lal
.
Jewels! Jacinta,now indeed, Jacinta,
I thought not of the jewels.
Jac
.
Oh! perhaps not!
But then I might have sworn it. After all,
There's Ugo says the ring is only paste,
For he's sure the Count Castiglione never
Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
And at the best I'm certain, Madam, you cannot
Have use for jewels
now
. But I might have sworn it.
(
exit
.)
(
Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the
tableafter a short pause raises it
.)
Lal
.
Poor Lalage!and is it come to this?
Thy servant maid!but courage!'tis but a viper
Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
(taking up the mirror.)
Ha! here at least's a friendtoo much a friend
In earlier daysa friend will not deceive thee.
Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
A talea pretty taleand heed thou not
Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
And Beauty long deceasedremembers me
Of Joy departedHope, the Seraph Hope,
Inurned and entombed!now, in a tone
Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!thou liest not!
Thou
hast no end to gainno heart to break
Castiglione lied who said he loved
Thou truehe false!false!false!
(
while she speaks, a monk enters her apartment, and
approaches
unobserved
.)
Monk
.
Refuge thou hast,
Sweet daughter! in Heaven. Think of eternal things!
Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!
Lal
.
(
arising hurriedly
.)
I
cannot
pray!My soul is at war
with God!
The frightful sounds of merriment below
Disturb my sensesgo! I cannot pray
The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
Thy presence grieves mego!thy priestly raiment
Fills me with dreadthy ebony crucifix
With horror and awe!
Monk
.
Think of thy precious soul!
Lal
.
Think of my early days!think of my father
And mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,
And the rivulet that ran before the door!
Think of my little sisters!think of them!
And think of me!think of my trusting love
And confidencehis vowsmy ruinthinkthink
Of my unspeakable misery!begone!
Yet stay! yet stay!what was it thou saidst of prayer
And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
And vows before the throne?
Monk
.
I did.
Lal
.
'Tis well.
There
is
a vow were fitting should be made
A sacred vow, imperative, and urgent,
A solemn vow!
Monk
.
Daughter, this zeal is well!
Lal
.
Father, this zeal is anything but well!
Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
A crucifix whereon to register
This sacred vow?
(
he hands her his own
.)
Not thatOh! no!no!no!
(
shuddering
.)
Not that! Not that!I tell thee, holy man,
Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,
I
have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting
The deedthe vowthe symbol of the deed
And the deed's register should tally, father!
(
draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high
.)
Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
Is written in Heaven!
Monk
.
Thy words are madness, daughter,
And speak a purpose unholythy lips are livid
Thine eyes are wildtempt not the wrath divine!
Pause ere too late!oh be notbe not rash!
Swear not the oathoh swear it not!
Lal
.
'Tis sworn!
III.
An apartment in a palace. Politian and Baldazzar.
Baldazzar
.
Arouse thee now, Politian!
Thou must notnay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
Give way unto these humours. Be thyself!
Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,
And live, for now thou diest!
Politian
.
Not so, Baldazzar!
Surely
I live.
Bal
.
Politian, it doth grieve me
To see thee thus.
Pol
.
Baldazzar, it doth grieve me
To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.
Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?
At thy behest I will shake off that nature
Which from my forefathers I did inherit,
Which with my mother's milk I did imbibe,
And be no more Politian, but some other.
Command me, sir!
Bal
.
To the field thento the field
To the senate or the field.
Pol
.
Alas! alas!
There is an imp would follow me even there!
There is an imp
hath
followed me even there!
There iswhat voice was that?
Bal
.
I heard it not.
I heard not any voice except thine own,
And the echo of thine own.
Pol
.
Then I but dreamed.
Bal
.
Give not thy soul to dreams: the campthe court
Befit theeFame awaits theeGlory calls
And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
In hearkening to imaginary sounds
And phantom voices.
Pol
.
It
is
a phantom voice!
Didst thou not hear it
then
?
Bal
.
I heard it not.
Pol
.
Thou heardst it not!Baldazzar, speak no more
To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.
Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!
We have been boys togetherschool-fellows
And now are friendsyet shall not be so long
For in the eternal city thou shalt do me
A kind and gentle office, and a Power
A Power august, benignant and supreme
Shall then absolve thee of all farther duties
Unto thy friend.
Bal
.
Thou speakest a fearful riddle
I
will
not understand.
Pol
.
Yet now as Fate
Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,
The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,
And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!
I
cannot
die, having within my heart
So keen a relish for the beautiful
As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
Is balmier now than it was wont to be
Rich melodies are floating in the winds
A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth
And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
Sitteth in Heaven.Hist! hist! thou canst not say
Thou hearest not
now,
Baldazzar?
Bal
.
Indeed I hear not.
Pol
.
Not hear it!listen nowlisten!the faintest sound
And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
A lady's voice!and sorrow in the tone!
Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
Again!again!how solemnly it falls
Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
Surely I never heardyet it were well
Had I
but
heard it with its thrilling tones
In earlier days!
Bal
.
I myself hear it now.
Be still!the voice, if I mistake not greatly,
Proceeds from yonder latticewhich you may see
Very plainly through the windowit belongs,
Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
The singer is undoubtedly beneath
The roof of his Excellencyand perhaps
Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
As the betrothed of Castiglione,
His son and heir.
Pol
.
Be still!it comes again!
Voice(very faintly.)
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus
Who hath loved thee so long
In wealth and wo among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say naysay nay!
Bal
.
The song is English, and I oft have heard it
In merry Englandnever so plaintively
Hist! hist! it comes again!
Voice(more loudly.)
Is it so strong
As for to leave me thus
Who hath loved thee so long
In wealth and wo among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say naysay nay!
Bal
.
'Tis hushed and all is still!
Pol
.
All
is not
still.
Bal
.
Let us go down.
Pol
.
Go down, Baldazzar, go!
Bal
.
The hour is growing latethe Duke awaits us,
Thy presence is expected in the hall
Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?
Voice(distinctly.)
Who hath loved thee so long,
In wealth and wo among,
And is thy heart so strong?
Say naysay nay!
Bal
.
Let us descend!'tis time. Politian, give
These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
Your bearing lately savoured much of rudeness
Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!
Pol
.
Remember? I do. Lead on! I
do
remember.
(
going
.)
Let us descend. Believe me I would give,
Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice
To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
Once more that silent tongue.
Bal
.
Let me beg you, sir,
Descend with methe Duke may be offended.
Let us go down, I pray you.
(
Voice loudly
.)
Say nay!say nay!
Pol
.
(
aside
.)
'Tis strange!'tis very strangemethought the
voice
Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!
(
approaching the window
.)
Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,
Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make
Apology unto the Duke for me;
I go not down to-night.
Bal
.
Your lordship's pleasure
Shall be attended to. Good night, Politian.
Pol
.
Good night, my friend, good night.
IV.
The gardens of a palaceMoonlight. Lalage and Politian.
Lalage
.
And dost thou speak of love
To
me,
Politian?dost thou speak of love
To Lalage?ah woah wo is me!
This mockery is most cruelmost cruel indeed!
Politian
.
Weep not! oh, sob not thus!thy bitter tears
Will madden me. Oh mourn not, Lalage
Be comforted! I knowI know it all,
And
still
I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,
And beautiful Lalage!turn here thine eyes!
Thou askest me if I could speak of love,
Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.
Thou askest me thatand thus I answer thee
Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.
(
kneeling
.)
Sweet Lalage,
I love theelove theelove thee;
Thro' good and illthro' weal and wo I
love thee
.
Not mother, with her first born on her knee,
Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
Not on God's altar, in any time or clime,
Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
Within my spirit for
thee
. And do I love?
(
arising
.)
Even for thy woes I love theeeven for thy woes
Thy beauty and thy woes.
Lal
.
Alas, proud Earl,
Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens
Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
Could the dishonoured Lalage abide?
Thy wife, and with a tainted memory
My seared and blighted name, how would it tally
With the ancestral honours of thy house,
And with thy glory?
Pol
.
Speak not to me of glory!
I hateI loathe the name; I do abhor
The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?
Do I not loveart thou not beautiful
What need we more? Ha! glory!now speak not of it!
By all I hold most sacred and most solemn
By all my wishes nowmy fears hereafter
By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven
There is no deed I would more glory in,
Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
And trample it under foot. What matters it
What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
That we go down unhonoured and forgotten
Into the dustso we descend together.
Descend togetherand thenand then perchance
Lal
.
Why dost thou pause, Politian?
Pol
.
And then perchance
Arise
together, Lalage, and roam
The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
And still
Lal
.
Why dost thou pause, Politian?
Pol
.
And still
togethertogether
.
Lal
.
Now Earl of Leicester!
Thou
lovest
me, and in my heart of hearts
I feel thou lovest me truly.
Pol
.
Oh, Lalage!
(
throwing himself upon his knee
.)
And lovest thou
me?
Lal.
Hist! hush! within the gloom
Of yonder trees methought a figure past
A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless
Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.
(
walks across and returns
.)
I was mistaken'twas but a giant bough
Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!
Pol.
My Lalagemy love! why art thou moved?
Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience' self,
Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
Is chillyand these melancholy boughs
Throw over all things a gloom.
Lal.
Politian!
Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
With which all tongues are busya land new found
Miraculously found by one of Genoa
A thousand leagues within the golden west?
A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,
And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
Of Heaven untrammelled flowwhich air to breathe
Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter
In days that are to come?
Pol.
O, wilt thouwilt thou
Fly to that Paradisemy Lalage, wilt thou
Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,
And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.
And life shall then be mine, for I will live
For thee, and in thine eyesand thou shalt be
No more a mournerbut the radiant Joys
Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope
Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
My all;oh, wilt thouwilt thou, Lalage,
Fly thither with me?
Lal
.
A deed is to be done
Castiglione lives!
Pol
.
And he shall die!
(
exit

Lal
.
(
after a pause
.)
Andheshalldie!alas!
Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
Where am I?what was it he said?Politian!
Thou
art
not gonethou art not
gone,
Politian!
I
feel
thou art not goneyet dare not look,
Lest I behold thee not; thou
couldst
not go
With those words upon thy lipsO, speak to me!
And let me hear thy voiceone wordone word,
To say thou art not gone,one little sentence,
To say how thou dost scornhow thou dost hate
My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou
art
not gone
O speak to me! I
knew
thou wouldst not go!
I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not,
durst
not go.
Villain, thou
art
not gonethou mockest me!
And thus I clutch theethus!He is gone, he is gone
Gonegone. Where am I?'tis well'tis very well!
So that the blade be keenthe blow be sure,
'Tis well, 'tis

Politian
.
This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,
And much I fear me illit will not do
To die ere I have lived!Staystay thy hand,
O Azrael, yet awhile!Prince of the Powers
Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!
O pity me! let me not perish now,
In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
Give me to live yetyet a little while:
'Tis I who pray for lifeI who so late
Demanded but to die!what sayeth the Count?
Enter Baldazzar
.
Baldazzar
.
That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
Between the Earl Politian and himself,
He doth decline your cartel.
Pol
.
What
didst thou say?
What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?
With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
Laden from yonder bowers!a fairer day,
Or one more worthy Italy, methinks
No mortal eyes have seen!
what
said the Count?
Bal
.
That he, Castiglione, not being aware
Of any feud existing, or any cause
Of quarrel between your lordship and himself
Cannot accept the challenge.
Pol
.
It is most true
All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid
Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,
A heaven so calm as thisso utterly free
From the evil taint of clouds?and he did
say?
Bal
.
No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:
The Count Castiglione will not fight,
Having no cause for quarrel.
Pol
.
Now this is true
All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,
And I have not forgotten itthou'lt do me
A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say
Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,
Hold him a villain?thus much, I prythee, say
Unto the Countit is exceeding just
He should have cause for quarrel.
Bal
.
My lord!my friend!
Pol
.
(
aside
.)
'Tis hehe comes himself!
(
aloud
.)
thou
reasonest
well.
I know what thou wouldst saynot send the message
Well!I will think of itI will not send it.
Now prythee, leave mehither doth come a person
With whom affairs of a most private nature
I would adjust.
Bal

I goto-morrow we meet,
Do we not?at the Vatican.
Pol
.
At the Vatican.
(
exit Bal
.)
Enter Castiglione
.
Cas
.
The Earl of Leicester here!
Pol
.
I
am
the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,
Dost thou not? that I am here.
Cas
.
My lord, some strange,
Some singular mistakemisunderstanding
Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
To me, Castiglione; the bearer being
Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware
Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
Having given thee no offence. Ha!am I right?
'Twas a mistake?undoubtedlywe all
Do err at times.
Pol
.
Draw, villain, and prate no more!
Cas
.
Ha!draw?and villain? have at thee then at once,
Proud Earl!
(
draws
.)
Pol
.
(
drawing

Thus to the expiatory tomb,
Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee
In the name of Lalage!
Cas

(
letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of
the stage
.)
Of Lalage!
Hold offthy sacred hand!avaunt I say!
AvauntI will not fight theeindeed I dare not.
Pol
.
Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?
Shall I be baffled thus?now this is well;
Didst say thou
darest
not? Ha!
Cas
.
I dare notdare not
Hold off thy handwith that beloved name
So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee
I cannotdare not.
Pol
.
Now by my halidom
I do believe thee!coward, I do believe thee!
Cas
.
Ha!coward!this may not be!
(
clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his
purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls
upon his knee at the feet of the Earl
.)
Alas! my lord,
It isit ismost true. In such a cause
I am the veriest coward. O pity me!
Pol
.
(
greatly softened
.)
Alas!I doindeed I pity thee.
Cas
.
And Lalage
Pol
.
Scoundrel!arise and die!
Cas
.
It needeth not bethusthusO let me die
Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
That in this deep humiliation I perish.
For in the fight I will not raise a hand
Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home
(
baring his bosom
.)
Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon
Strike home. I
will not
fight thee.
Pol
.
Now s'Death and Hell!
Am I notam I not sorelygrievously tempted
To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir!
Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
For public insult in the streetsbefore
The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee
Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee
Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest
Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,I'll taunt thee,
Dost hear? with
cowardice
thou
wilt not
fight me?
Thou liest! thou
shalt!

Science
! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?

A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared suddenly in the
heavensattained, in a few days, a brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiterthen
as suddenly disappeared, and has never been seen since.
PART I.
O!
Nothing
earthly save the ray
(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy
O! nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill
Or (music of the passion-hearted)
Joy's voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell,
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell
Oh, nothing of the dross of ours
Yet all the beautyall the flowers
That list our Love, and deck our bowers
Adorn yon world afar, afar
The wandering star.
'Twas a sweet time for Nesacefor there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air,

An oasis in desert of the blest.
Awayaway'mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul
The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence
To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
And late to ours, the favour'd one of God
But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
She throws aside the sceptreleaves the helm,
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.
Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
Whence sprang the Idea of Beauty into birth,
(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)
She look'd into Infinityand knelt.
Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled
Fit emblems of the model of her world
Seen but in beautynot impeding sight
Of other beauty glittering thro' the light
A wreath that twined each starry form around,
And all the opal'd air in color bound.
All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head

And fell on gardens of the unforgiven

It still remaineth, torturing the bee
With madness, and unwonted reverie:
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
Disconsolate lingergrief that hangs her head,
Repenting follies that full long have fled,
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,

The drift of Milton's argument, leads him to employ language which would
appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be seen
immediately
,
that he guards himself against the charge of having adopted one of
the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church.
Dr. Sumner's Notes
on Milton's Christian Doctrine
.
This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never have
been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of Mesopotamia, was condemned for
the opinion, as heretical. He lived in the beginning of the fourth century.
His disciples were called Anthropmorphites.

Among Milton's minor poems are these lines:
Dicite sacrorum prsides nemorum De, &c.
Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine

Eternus, incorruptus, quvus polo,
Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.And Afterwards,
Non cui profuadum Ccitas lumen dedit
Dircus augur vidit hune alto sinu, &c.
A model of their own
Thy will is done, Oh, God!
The star hath ridden high
Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye;
And here, in thought, to thee
In thought that can alone
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne

A shelter from the fervour of His eye;
For the stars trembled at the Deity.

A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere.

High
on a mountain of enamell'd head
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
With many a mutter'd hope to be forgiven
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven
Of rosy head, that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eveat noon of night,
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light
Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
And nursled the young mountain in its lair.

Of shak'd Olympus, by mischance, did fall.

Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution, while they die
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
Sat gently on these columns as a crown
A window of one circular diamond, there,
Look'd out above into the purple air,
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,
Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that greyish green
That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave
And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peerd out,
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche
Achaian statues in a world so rich?

Oh! the waveUla Deguisi is the Turkish appellation; but, on its
own shores, it is called Bahar Loth, or Almotanah. There were undoubtedly
more than two cities engulphed in the dead sea. In the valley of Siddim
were fiveAdrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah. Stephen of
Byzantium
mentions eight, and Strabo thirteen, (engulphed)but the last is out of
all reason.
It is said, [Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau, Maundrell,
Troilo, D'Arvieux] that after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns,
walls, &c. are seen above the surface. At
any
season, such remains may be
discovered by looking down into the transparent lake, and at such distances as
would argue the existence of many settlements in the space now usurped by
the `Asphaltites.'

I have often thought I could distinctly hear the sound of the darkness as it

Is not its formits voicemost palpable and loud?
But what is this?it comethand it brings
A music with it'tis the rush of wings
A pauseand then a sweeping, falling strain
And Nesace is in her halls again.
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.

She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that nightand tree to tree;
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;

And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:
'Neath blue-bell or streamer

In Scripture is this passageThe sun shall not harm thee by day, nor
the moon by night. It is perhaps not generally known that the moon, in
Egypt, has the effect of producing blindness to those who sleep with the face
exposed to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently alludes.

Bright beings! that ponder,
With half closing eyes,
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies,
Till they glance thro' the shade, and
Come down to your brow
Likeeyes of the maiden

Arise! from your dreaming
In violet bowers,
To duty beseeming
These star-litten hours
And shake from your tresses
Encumber'd with dew
The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too
(O! how, without you, Love!
Could angels be blest?)
Those kisses of true love
That lull'd ye to rest!

Each hindering thing:
The dew of the night
It would weigh down your flight;
And true love caresses
O! leave them apart!
They are light on the tresses,
But lead on the heart.

Like the lone Albatross,
Incumbent on night

Thy image may be,
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee.

obtain
and quote from memory:The verie essence and, as it were,

From the growing of grass
Are the music of things

Away, then my dearest,
O! hie thee away
To springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moon-ray
To lone lake that smiles,
In its dream of deep rest,
At the many star-isles
That enjewel its breast
Where wild flowers, creeping,
Have mingled their shade,
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid
Some have left the cool glade, and

The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be moonlight.
The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty lines before, has an
appearance
of affectation. It is, however, imitated from Sir W. Scott, or rather from
Claud Halcroin whose mouth. I admired its effect:
O! were there an island,
Tho' ever so wild
Where woman might smile, and
No man be beguil'd, &c.
Have slept with the bee
Arouse them my maiden,
On moorland and lea
Go! breathe on their slumber,
All softly in ear,

They slumber'd to hear
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon,
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test,
The rhythmical number
Which lull'd him to rest?
Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight

Sweet was that errorsweeter still that death
Sweet was that errorev'n with

Of Science dims the mirror of our joy

With the last ecstasy of satiate life
Beyond that death no immortality
But sleep that pondereth and is not to be

Unguided Love hath fallen'mid tears of perfect moan.
He was a goodly spirithe who fell:
A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well
A gazer on the lights that shine above
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair
And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
The night had found (to him a night of wo)
Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.

Now turn'd it upon herbut ever then
It trembled to the orb of
Earth
again.

How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles the
delirium
of opium. The passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit
attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasuresthe price of which, to
those souls who make choice of Al Aaraaf as their residence after life, is final
death and annihilation.
She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve

Perhaps my brain grew dizzybut the world

And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar
And fellnot swiftly as I rose before,
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours
Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
A red Ddalion on the timid Earth.
We cameand to thy Earthbut not to us
Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:
We came, my love; around, above, below,
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
She
grants to us, as granted by her God
But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd
Never his fairy wing o'er fairier world!
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea
But when its glory swell'd upon the sky,
As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,
We paus'd before the heritage of men,
And thy star trembledas doth Beauty then!

Kind
solace in a dying hour!
Such, father, is not (now) my theme
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revell'd in
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hopethat fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If I
can
hopeOh God! I can
Its fount is holiermore divine
I would not call thee fool, old man,
But such is not a gift of thine.
Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bow'd from its wild pride into shame.
O yearning heart! I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame,
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the Jewels of my throne,
Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again
O craving heart, for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
The undying voice of that dead time,
With its interminable chime,
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
Upon thy emptinessa knell.
I have not always been as now:
The fever'd diadem on my brow
I claim'd and won usurpingly
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the Csarthis to me?
The heritage of a kingly mind,
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind.
On mountain soil I first drew life:
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head,
And, I believe, the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair.
So late from Heaventhat dewit fell
('Mid dreams of an unholy night)
Upon me with the touch of Hell,
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
Appeared to my half-closing eye
The pageantry of monarchy,
And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
Came hurriedly upon me, telling
Of human battle, where my voice,
My own voice, silly child!was swelling
(O! how my spirit would rejoice,
And leap within me at the cry)
The battle-cry of Victory!
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelter'dand the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
It was but man, I thought, who shed
Laurels upon me: and the rush
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empireswith the captive's prayer
The hum of suitorsand the tone
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.
My passions, from that hapless hour,
Usurp'd a tyranny which men
Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power,
My innate naturebe it so:
But, father, there liv'd one who, then,
Thenin my boyhoodwhen their fire
Burn'd with a still intenser glow
(For passion must, with youth, expire)
E'en then who knew this iron heart
In woman's weakness had a part.
I have no wordsalas!to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
Areshadows on th' unstable wind:
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon,
With loitering eye, till I have felt
The letterswith their meaningmelt
To fantasieswith none.
O, she was worthy of all love!
Loveas in infancy was mine
'Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incensethen a goodly gift,
For they were childish and upright
Pureas her young example taught:
Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
Trust to the fire within, for light?
We grew in ageand lovetogether
Roaming the forest, and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather
And, when the friendly sunshine smil'd,
And she would mark the opening skies,
I saw no Heavenbut in her eyes.
Young Love's first lesson isthe heart:
For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
When, from our little cares apart,
And laughing at her girlish wiles,
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
And pour my spirit out in tears
There was no need to speak the rest
No need to quiet any fears
Of herwho ask'd no reason why,
But turn'd on me her quiet eye!
Yet
more
than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with, and strove,
When, on the mountain peak, alone,
Ambition lent it a new tone
I had no beingbut in thee:
The world, and all it did contain
In the earththe airthe sea
Its joyits little lot of pain
That was new pleasurethe ideal,
Dim, vanities of dreams by night
And dimmer nothings which were real
(Shadowsand a more shadowy light!)
Parted upon their misty wings,
And, so, confusedly, became
Thine image anda namea name!
Two separateyet most intimate things.
I was ambitioushave you known
The passion, father? You have not:
A cottager, I mark'd a throne
Of half the world as all my own,
And murmur'd at such lowly lot
But, just like any other dream,
Upon the vapor of the dew
My own had past, did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro'
The minutethe hourthe dayoppress
My mind with double loveliness.
We walk'd together on the crown
Of a high mountain which look'd down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest, on the hills
The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills.
I spoke to her of power and pride,
But mysticallyin such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moment's converse; in her eyes
I read, perhaps too carelessly
A mingled feeling with my own
The flush on her bright cheek, to me
Seem'd to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone.
I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then
And donn'd a visionary crown
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me
But that, among the rabblemen,
Lion ambition is chain'd down
And crouches to a keeper's hand
Not so in deserts where the grand
The wildthe terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire.
Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!
Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
Above all cities? in her hand
Their destinies? in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone?
Fallingher veriest stepping-stone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne
And who her sovereign? Timourhe
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding o'er empires haughtily
A diadem'd outlaw!
O, human love! thou spirit given,
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
Which fall'st into the soul like rain
Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain,
And, failing in thy power to bless,
But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
Idea! which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth
Farewell! for I have won the Earth.
When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky,
His pinions were bent droopingly
And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye.
'Twas sunset: when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun.
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist
So often lovely, and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness (known
To those whose spirits harken) as one
Who, in a dream of night,
would
fly
But
cannot
from a danger nigh.
What tho' the moonthe white moon
Shed all the splendor of her noon,
Her
smile is chillyand
her
beam,
In that time of dreariness, will seem
(So like you gather in your breath)
A portrait taken after death.

And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one
For all we live to know is known
And all we seek to keep hath flown
Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
With the noon-day beautywhich is all.
I reach'd my homemy home no more
For all had flown who made it so.
I pass'd from out its mossy door,
And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known
O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
On beds of fire that burn below,
An humbler hearta deeper wo.
Father, I firmly do believe
I knowfor Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar,
Where there is nothing to deceive,
Hath left his iron gate ajar,
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro' Eternity
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path
Else how, when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol, Love,
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most unpolluted things,
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellic'd rays from Heaven
No mote may shunno tiniest fly
The light'ning of his eagle eye
How was it that Ambition crept,
Unseen, amid the revels there,
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Love's very hair?
A DREAM.
In
visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.
Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?
That holy dreamthat holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding.
What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth's day-star?
ROMANCE.
Romance,
who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath beena most familiar bird
Taught me my alphabet to say
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie,
A childwith a most knowing eye.
Of late, eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while awayforbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings.
FAIRY-LAND.
Dim
valesand shadowy floods
And cloudy-looking woods,
Whose forms we can't discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane
Againagainagain
Every moment of the night
Forever changing places
And they put out the star-light
With the breath from their pale faces.
About twelve by the moon-dial
One more filmy than the rest
(A kind which, upon trial,
They have found to be the best)
Comes downstill downand down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountain's eminence,
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets, over halls,
Wherever they may be
O'er the strange woodso'er the sea
Over spirits on the wing
Over every drowsy thing
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light
And then, how deep!O, deep!
Is the passion of their sleep.
In the morning they arise,
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies,
With the tempests as they toss,
Likealmost any thing
Or a yellow Albatross.
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before
Videlicet a tent
Which I think extravagant:
Its atomies, however,
Into a shower dissever,
Of which those butterflies,
Of Earth, who seek the skies,
And so come down again
(Never-contented things!)
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings.
TO
The
bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
The wantonest singing birds,
Are lipsand all thy melody
Of lip-begotten words
Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined
Then desolately fall,
O God! on my funereal mind
Like starlight on a pall
Thy heart
thy
heart!I wake and sigh,
And sleep to dream till day
Of the truth that gold can never buy
Of the baubles that it may.
TO THE RIVER .
Fair
river! in thy bright, clear flow
Of crystal, wandering water,
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beautythe unhidden heart
The playful maziness of art
In old Alberto's daughter;
But when within thy wave she looks
Which glistens then, and trembles
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart, as in thy stream,
Her image deeply lies
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul-searching eyes.
THE LAKETO
In
spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
And the tall pines that towered around.
But when the Night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot, as upon all,
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody
Thenah then I would awake
To the terror of the lone lake.
Yet that terror was not fright,
But a tremulous delight
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define
Nor Lovealthough the Love were thine.
Death was in that poisonous wave,
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake.
SONG.
I saw
thee on thy bridal day
When a burning blush came o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee:
And in thine eye a kindling light
(Whatever it might be)
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see.
That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame
As such it well may pass
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him, alas!
Who saw thee on that bridal day,
When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee,
TO HELEN.
Helen,
thy beauty is to me
Like those Nican barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, way-worn wanderer bore
To his own native shore.
On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece,
And the grandeur that was Rome.
Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
How statue-like I see thee stand,
The agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy-Land!
