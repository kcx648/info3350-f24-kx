CHAPTER I.
What
ails you, my dear? inquired Robert
Barclay of his wife, as she sat thoughtfully,
twirling her tea-cup. You seem, of late, very
uninterested in my conversation. Has any
thing gone wrong with you to-day?
No, nothing in particular to-day! she
replied
,
with an emphasis. I have been
thinking
the same thing over and over again for
some weeks; and is not that about as long as
you have noticed my abstracted manner?
Well, well, do let us know what the secret
is, said the half-irritated husband; for this
playing upon words, and inquiries about this
and that state of mind, is poor business for man
and wife; and, for mercy's sake, do let us
abandon it now and forever. So tell me,
Hepsy
,
at once, what you are brooding over.
Well, then, if you would know all (and you
may as well, I suppose), said the troubled wife
and mother, it was about a month ago I
was dreadfully vexed with my cook and
chamber-maid
.
You know when Polly and Sally
had that `flare up'you remember Miss Jones
was staying with us; and, as we sat
descanting
upon the trials of housekeeping, she said to
me that `she wondered I had half the patience
I have; and were I in your cap,' said she, `I
never would suffer such annoyances; for half
what it costs you now you might board out,
and rid yourself of such troublesome scenes as
those you have been over to-day. I know
ladies
,'
she said, `who never pretend to rule their
husbandsonly in this matter of housekeeping,
and there they protest they will reign; and
as we live but one life,' said Miss Jones, `I am
for making people as comfortable as I can
while we stay here.' Now, husband, I confess
this did put a new wrinkle in my head, as old
grand-mother Lawrence used to say when a
new idea struck her. I have thought the
matter over and over since then, as I just
remarked
,
and I must say I am much disposed to
try the experiment. What say you? Come,
speak just as you think, for I have been frank
with you, husband.
Oh dear! sighed out Mr. Barclay, I am
sorry such a whim has got in your head, for I
see the result of it from beginning to end.
Now, I suppose, not a thing will take a
crooked
direction in kitchen, parlor, or nursery, but
boarding out will be the panacea. Why, just
look at things as they are, wife, and I think I
can convince you that I am as good a reasoner
as Fanny Jones, your adviser.
Don't reflect on her, husband; she would
die if she thought you supposed a silly whim
was put in my head by her; besides, she is not
the only person of that mind. Do see Mrs.
Bond, with her four children, at board: there
she sits, with every attention; nothing to do
unless
she chooses, never troubled about servants,
and always in full dress to see any one who
calls, while I am a mere drudge. If I ring a
bell, ten chances to one the girl is on the shed,
or cleaning the knives in the cellar; and yet
there are the wages, amounting to three dollars
a week, exclusive of board. Were I to urge
nothing but motives of economy, Mr. Barclay,
it seems to me the change must meet your
wishes.
Economy! retorted Mr. Barclay; that
is a good word, but it must be applied to good
uses, wife. You talk very foolishly, let me tell
you. When one boards, who takes care of the
children? who pays for the little attentions you
receive? who does the washing, and ironing,
and cooking?
Why, the landlord or landlady sees to
getting
it done, to be sure; I have no care if I
board, still reasoned Mrs. Barclay.
But I pay the bills, my dear. How much
do you suppose the Mr. Bond you just quoted
pays for himself, wife, four children, and
nursery-woman
?
Why, really, husband, I don't know;
perhaps
it
may be something likefifteen dollars
a week.
Just double that sum, Mrs. Barclay, and
you have it. He was speaking to me of his
expenses last spring, and remarked, that, could
he find an eligible house, he should return to
housekeeping, for the very reason you assign
for surrendering it, viz., economy!
Mrs. Barclay resumed her sewing, Mr.
Barclay
read the evening paper, a friend came in
to pass the evening, and thus ended the first
dialogue of this worthy pair.
But once get a notion thoroughly in a
woman's
head, and she will cling to it like ivy to the
oak! You may think you have reasoned it
away, that she will calmly sit down and do as
you desire; but if she is not fully convinced,
the idea will revive, and gain double weight at
every fresh glancing she gives it, especially if
her personal ease is concerned. As I would
preface
,
however, all women are not so; but the
majority, who have been vexed, will avail
themselves of a loophole to get out of the
trouble.
Mr. Barclay thought for some days he had
silenced his other half; not a word was said
about help, or children, or disorder.
The in-door arrangement worked finely; but
there used to be an old adage, After a calm
there comes a storm, and
vice vers
. Mrs.
Barclay had been out much of late; she urged
the plea that she had many friends to whom
she was indebted for calls, and resolved to
remain
their debtor no longer. Among these,
foremost on the list stood those who boarded.
Not one of these did she neglect; and in no
case did she have to reproach herself that she
had not inquired their opinions and preferences
between boarding and housekeeping; and
although
sometimes the recital was not
altogether
favorable to her wishes, she adroitly
managed so to forget and remember, that the
balance was always struck in favor of
boarding
.
B
CHAPTER II.
And
so you feel no reluctance, wife, to
giving
up this convenient house, with its
finely-warmed
apartments; the bathing apparatus;
the library, with its shelves so laden with books
to amuse, to instruct, and divert you; the
conveniences
of good closet-room, and those spare
chambers, where your friends are so well
accommodated
;
the commodious yard, the fine
prospect of the surrounding country, and all
the many advantages which this residence
possesses
,
and which you were so anxious I should
procure?
No, said Mrs. Barclay, not any.
And it will be a foolish waste of words for
me to urge the advantages we now possess
over a boarding-house; where the house is
another's, where you are circumscribed in
room, where the children are to be kept in
one apartment, and, instead of hospitality, no
friends can or will more than call; besides, the
uncertainty, dire uncertainty of getting
apartments
where a comfortable home and a
pleasant
landlady, and agreeable boarders are all
combined. You say, wife, you do not shrink
from this trial, if you can but forego the great
one of housekeeping.
If, husband, you only knew what I do of
the little daily vexations of living as we do, I
am sure you would not talk thus. But how
can you know? There you are at your store
from breakfast to dinner, from dinner to
supper
,
and the hour or two of relaxation you take
at home is undoubtedly pleasant. But what
can you know of my vexations? There I am,
cooped up in the nursery nearly two whole
days every week with the children; for Sally
is so slow with her washing and ironing, and
so talkative with Polly, that all my hurrying
her does no good; and then there are so many
stitches to be taken after all the seamstress
does, and so much fault-finding in the kitchen
because this or that thing is wanting, that I do,
husband, want to change. I will board just
where you say, town or country, if you will
but let me make the trial. If not, my health
will be ruined. I wonder you don't see how
fast I change; all my acquaintances tell me so;
and dear mother used to say, `Oh, Hepsy, your
cares will be the death of you!' Poor woman!
I realize it now you are dead.
Mr. Barclay bit his lips, but he was a
prudent
man, and saw plainly the die was cast.
He knew the temperament of his wife
head-strong
,
and not used to much contradiction;
and as he always contended that a woman
ought to rule in her own house, he now plainly
saw that submission was the better part of
valor. Coming home not more than a week
after he saw his fate, he brought in an
auctioneer
in a quiet manner, to ask his opinion how
it was best to dispose of his furniture. Mrs.
Barclay came down stairs, and the following
conversation was heard:
Mrs. Barclay, said the man of the
hammer
,
I think I should dislike to risk some of
these elegant articles to the promiscuous throng
which compose an auction; it is against my
interest to advise thus, but I do dislike to
`knock off' to a second-hand dealer the rich
and tasteful articles in a well-selected
drawing-room
,
library, &c., at less than half the cost.
I was suggesting to Mr. Barclay that perhaps
you had better keep those pictures, and that
suit of damask curtains. If you intend
boarding
,
be assured you will need many articles to
which you are accustomed; for I do not
believe a more merciless set of people are
found than your `first-rate boarding-house
landlords. I have had experience in these
matters
,
and, of course, as I give advice unasked,
it is gratis. But, pray, let me ask your reasons
for surrendering this beautiful establishment?
Your husband is prosperous and rich; no
mortgages
or assignee's sale is here. He paused
for an answer.
My health, sir, requires the surrender.
Oh! ah! said our kind adviser; then take
a voyage to Europe, or pass the winter in Cuba
or Savannah.
B 2
But my children, sir
No, Mr. G, said Mr. Barclay, it is
a freak my wife has taken to board! I
opposed
it at first with all my might, but have
now concluded to let her have her way; and
although it will subject me to many trials, in
no better way than experience can I show her
the folly of her course.
Well, well, chuckled the auctioneer, you
will give me a good job by the means, for which
I give Mrs. Barclay my most profound thanks;
and, with a graceful bow, he left the house.
CHAPTER III.
In
most of the daily papers on the
following
morning might be seen the advertisement
so common nowadays, with the caption,
Genteel
furniture. We will give a part of the
enumeration, that our readers may be in
possession
of the tasteful articles which Mrs.
Barclay
felt no regret at leaving or disposing
of to the highest bidder! It ran thus: On
Monday, January 25th, will be sold a great
variety of elegant household furniture, being
the property of R. Barclay, Esq., consisting,
in part, of superior new-style sofas and couches
in crimson damask coverings; twelve elegant
chairs to match; a divan; rich marble-top
center tables; large-size French mirrors,
original
cost three hundred dollars; and the richest
pair of girandoles ever offered at auction in
this market; two splendid inlaid stands; rich
gold-band coffee and tea sets; French China
dishes; one Britannia venison dish; sets of
silver-handle knives and forks; silver-plated
baskets, and a rich silver tea-service, very
large and heavy, &c., &c. At 11 o'clock, a
first-rate piano-forte of superior tone and finish;
also, a beautiful seraphim. A variety of kitchen
furniture, consisting of Wedgewood's Britannia
coffee-pots and biggins, and many choice
articles
of culinary ware too numerous to mention,
with which the sale will commence.
As Mr. Barclay glanced over his morning
paper, he perceived the above advertisement,
and, pointing to it, he passed it over to his wife.
She read unmoved until the piano and
seraphim
were announced for sale. This was
more than she could bear.
Robert, said she, those musical
instruments
must not be sold. I shall not permit it.
What on earth did you mean to advertise my
piano? As to the seraphim, I have already
purposed what to do with that; and the piano
I intend to carry with us where we board;
perhaps I shall find time then to take music
lessons. Cousin Fanny Jones said she would,
by all means; and as a mark of gratitude for
her services to us from time to time, I shall
present
her with our seraphim. So these will not
go under the auctioneer's hammer. Mr.
Barclay
simply remarked, The buckwheat cakes
were unusually light this morning; as if he
had not heard Mrs. Barclay's determinations
at all.
But breakfast with our good friends was
soon dispatched, and Mrs. Barclay made her
way to the kitchen, there to give orders for the
approaching event. Poor Polly Murphy, the
cook, had never heard of the projected affair;
for Sally, the nursery maid, and she had not
exchanged many words for some days, feeling
in no good humor with each other. Of course,
Sally knew all; for nursery women always
have eyes that see and ears that hear, and,
much to be regretted, sometimes tongues that
tell family secrets.
Polly, began Mrs. Barclay, we are soon
to break up housekeeping, and shall auction all
our furniture. There will of course be great
exposure of kitchen utensils, and I wish you to
make every thing thoroughly clean: to empty
all the buckets and boxes, scour them
thoroughly
,
likewise all the tin-ware, every pan,
dish, and spoon. You have three weeks to do
it in, and in the mean time our cooking will be
very light and simple; and, if possible, I shall
persuade Mr. Barclay to dine out, so that
every opportunity may be given you to do
your work well.
Polly stood aghast.
And what does it all mane? she inquired,
in her peculiar dialect. Sure, by the powers!
I niver expected Mr. Barclay would quit this
fine house; and isn't he going out of the
counthrey
,
that a trick the like o' this he is serving
us? Sure, indeed, Mrs. Barclay, I pity you
much, and will clane every thing in the finest
order; but my heart aches that you should be
obliged to lave such a beautiful risidence.
Mrs. Barclay soon quieted Polly's voluble
tongue by telling her it was not Mr.
Barclay
,
but herself that desired the change; to
all of which Polly would only reply, And,
sure, you are not the woman I took you to be.
However, the scouring process proceeded;
and, between muttering and reasoning alone
with herself, Polly put a new face upon
whatever
passed through her hands; not
unfrequently
,
however, did she bless her stars that
she should soon be rid of that despert
torment
,
the nursery woman, when she went to
a new place.
But it is no small affair to forego
housekeeping
.
The quickest way to end it is an
auction
;
but how often we sacrifice many choice
articles in the thoughtlessness and excitement
of the moment, which we greatly need
afterward
.
Mrs. Barclay seemed not to foresee
that at board any thing need be useful, as
every thing would be supplied! This fact
alone tells the story that she never had any
experience
in the matter. But what was to be
done? Here was the day fixed for the sale;
things were in a topsy-turvy condition; she
had no boarding place engaged, and Mr.
Barclay
seemed to rely upon her to procure one.
But Mrs. Barclay was a woman of expedients,
if not experience. She never met with an
adventure
,
or carried out a long-concerted plan,
but Cousin Fanny Jones was her adviser.
Of course, now her aid would be indispensable.
The letter-bag had not closed for D that
day, ere a note was dispatched with the
following
contents. It may serve to enlighten
the reader as to who was at the bottom of this
troublesome change:
Boston,
December 20th,
Dear Fanny
,
Our plans are all arranged. Little did I
think, when we conversed together upon the
subject of my giving up housekeeping, I should
so soon carry into effect your plan. I call it
yours, for you first suggested to me the
expedient
of ridding myself of domestic trials. Mr.
Barclay was at first wholly averse to hearing
a word about it; but, dear Fanny, I talked
hours, yes! days, until he yielded! Was he
not a kind husband? I never suggested to him
that you were prime mover, lest in future time,
if things should not turn out well, you might
be reproached. But, cousin, I am wholly
unacquainted
with the process of `breaking up
housekeeping.' I thought we should never get
furnished when we moved here; and now I
feel as if we never should get things in order
for the sale, unless you come immediately and
help me. You will therefore stand by me for
at least three or four weeks; help me look out
a boarding-house, &c. Come in the four o'clock
omnibus this afternoon. Truly,
H.
Barclay
.
Fanny, said old Mrs. Jones, as she read
that note, you have taken a mighty
responsibility
upon yourself; it will never do for you
to go first in all these affairs. It is not at all
likely any boarding-house can be found for
such a family that will give satisfaction. I am
sure, much as I respect the Barclays, no money
would induce me to take them for a single
week.
C
Thank you, mother, for your advice; but
Mrs. Barclay and I will manage well enough.
Barclay, you know, is always at his business;
and, surely, you would not have me refuse
such a pressing invitation as this note
conveys
?
Well, child, if you go, don't interfere too
much between Robert and Hepsy; they are
man and wife, you know, and he is a good,
indulgent
husband.
In less than four hours from the reception
of the note Fanny Jones was at Mrs. Barclay's
window, planning for her what she had best
do, what articles had better be reserved, what
disposed of, &c.
But, first, said she, we must see where
you can get boarded. I will call on Mrs. Bell,
and get a list of `the most fashionable
boarding-houses
,'
and the names of the keepers.
Suiting her action to the word, she was soon
in Mrs. Bell's parlor, with her pencil and
memorandum-book
,
registering names!
Mr. Barclay behaved like a philosopher.
He even told Fanny that he appreciated her
kindness, and desired her to accompany his
wife in her perambulations, adding, When
you have found the place, I will make the
bargain
.
The next morning was a cloudy one; but,
with business before them, the two cousins
commenced their preparations in search of a
new home.
You had better, said Fanny, put on your
pink hat, and velvet shawl, and dark silk dress;
for appearances, you know, count, when one
goes among strangers upon such an errand as
ours.
No, cousin, I don't know any thing about
it; and so I sent on purpose for you to tell
me.
Fanny had recourse to her memoranda.
Let us go to Mrs. Marshall's first, said
she; for her house is highly praised, and, if
we can, we will secure a suit of rooms with
her. And to Mrs. Marshall's they went.
A very polite, bowing servant took their
address
,
and leaving them for full fifteen minutes
in a kind of ante-room, came back and
informed
them that Mrs. Marshall was not at
home; that she received applications of
business
only between four and six o'clock P.M.;
that her house was full, but some vacancies, he
had heard her remark, would take place in
Aprilall of which, however, she would
inform
them, would they call at the hours
specified
!
The next call of our friends was upon Mrs.
Gori, a lady of French extraction, who rented
a house in  Square. Madame Gori
was luckily at home, and could be seen. Our
friends were conducted up a winding passage
to her splendid drawing-rooms. In a few
moments
madame entered. But, mercy! what a
curiosity in person! Can any one describe
her? Is it wrong to attempt it? Let me
venture a little, hoping the sin, if it be one,
will be pardoned; and, should the good lady
see herself in a book, she may be induced to
abandon a part of her toggery. Her dress
was of a nameless fabric, fancifully
embroidered
at the bottom with blue and scarlet velvet,
edged with black and white beads. Her
slippers
were a kind of moccason, flowered with
the porcupine quill, and upon her head, the
crowning point, was a huge turban, with a frill
about the face, and bows of ribbon of every
shade and hue! Besides, she was a bad
English
scholar, and it was with extreme difficulty
she could be made to understand how many
were desirous of procuring board, and what
rooms they wished; but
oui, voulez vous
, &c.,
and a beckoning of the hand, led our friends to
the vacated rooms. They were in the third
story, and such rooms! Seams in the floor
some inches apart; paint the color of a saffron
dye; a door that would not close but with a
violent jerk; with but one closet, already
occupied
by sundry vermin, and a back room of
similar conveniences, give us a view of all she
had to let! But two words were
intelligible
to Mrs. Barclay, and those seemed as if
uttered by Madame Gori in ridicule, they
C 2
were so singularly inappropriate: Very
convenient
,
madame! Fanny smirked and
winked
at her cousin, and inquired, What price?
Only twenty dollar for familie of five, she
made out to interpret as her meaning; very
cheap! But they would call again if they
decided.
Oui! bon jour
, and the door
closed forever upon Madame Gori. Nothing
daunted, Fanny again took out her book.
Do let us go to some real `fashionable
place,' said Mrs. Barclay; these can not be
very good specimens we have seen. I desire,
if I board, to find a house equal to the one I
leave. Do you suppose I shall? asked Mrs.
Barclay, rather despondingly.
Twice as good, promptly responded
Fanny
;
and, at any rate, you won't have such
an everlasting care upon your shoulders;
and now they are at Mrs. W's door, a
boarding-house of first quality, first price, &c.
The drawing-rooms here have an antique
look; the red curtains are faded; the carpets
are worn; the mirrors are tarnished; the
chairs are dull; the couches have been much
used, and the center-table is cracked! And
all these are in good keeping with the two
antiquated
sisters who keep the house. Age has
wrinkled their faces, and stray silvery
tell-tales
peep out from beneath their caps! A
very unmusical voice, as if used to command,
issues from the elder lady, who seems to have
the principal management of the large
establishment
.
Even Fanny quailed somewhat;
and Mrs. Barclay declared her voice faltered
as she inquired if they had vacant rooms.
With an evasive answer, the old lady proposed
another question to our friends: Have you
young children? James, and John, and little
Fanny all rose before Mrs. Barclay's vision;
she could only stammer out, Whynot very
young; my boys are eight and twelve, and my
little girl but three years of age.
Then, sister, said Miss Jemima, the
younger of the two, to Miss Dorothy, the
negotiator
,
it's of no use, sister; you know we
can not have children of such ages. Why,
General D and Commodore F would
leave at once, to be annoyed by a crying child.
You may as well say the truth, Dollywe
don't board children. She puckered up her
mouth, cast a significant glance at the ladies,
as if to say, We have no accommodations!
But Dolly W never allowed persons
to apply without giving their names. She
inquired
of Mrs. Barclay her address. Robert
Barclay, commission-merchant, was a name
she had somehow got identified with wealth;
she thought, with her finger on her lip, as if by
this action she quickened her decaying
memory
.
Barclay? said she three several times.
Is he the gentleman who has advertised his
furniture at auction?
The same, sister, that Colonel Gardner
spoke of this morning; you know he
recommended
us to attend the auction, as there was
a venison dish to be sold; and Colonel
Gardner
,
she remarked, is very fond of venison.
The maiden ladies seemed to clear up their
throats, and really much more agreeable voices
were now heard. I don't know, said the
bargainer, but we have a suit of rooms that
will be vacated this spring; they are below
us; a basement that the Spanish consul now
occupies, and a small room that is occupied
by Lieutenant Ames.
If you please, we will look at them, said
Mrs. Barclay.
Imagine, kind reader, a basement room
exceedingly
low in the story; a fireplace with
little ancient marble tiles around the stove; an
alcove for a bed, and a low, wide window
looking
directly upon the sidewalk, and your
imagination
will supply the rest. The small room
adjoining seemed originally planned for a large
closet; but our close, calculating friends had
contrived to make the lodger therein believe
it a bedroom; and these were the apartments
soon to be vacated, and, if they could
dispose
of their children, perhaps might be
secured
by R. Barclay and lady at the moderate
terms of eighteen dollars per week!
CHAPTER IV.
One
whole forenoon has been spent in
perambulating
the streets, and visiting
fashionable
boarding-houses, the result of which you
are fully apprised of thus far. Mrs. Barclay
and Fanny have returned home, well tired with
their unsuccessful efforts. Mr. Barclay came
home rather later than usual to dinner, and
jocosely
inquired, What success in your labors,
ladies, to-day? You look dreadfully jaded. I
think no place offers for me to bargain about.
I do not know that I have any where spoken
of one trait in Mrs. Barclay's character; she
had indomitable perseverance. Rather than
surrender a plan she had fully determined to
execute, she would almost submit to
martyrdom
.
Vexed and chagrined as she already
felt with her morning's discomfitures, both her
cousin and herself resolved that no third
person
should know it. Under plea, however, of
giving the nursery maid an opportunity to go
out, she left the dining-room to Fanny and Mr.
Barclay, while she attended little Fanny,
the elder's namesake. A
tte--tte
between
Mr. Barclay and Fanny now ensued, and let
us hear how adroitly Miss Jones can
accommodate
herself to Mr. Barclay's views.
I don't know as you agree with me,
remarked
Mr. Barclay, but I have been, and
am still, exceedingly adverse to the change we
are about making; but, as we have proceeded
too far to retrace our steps, I intend to bear
with fortitude whatever falls to my lot. But
I doubt not your cousin will, in a month's time,
wish herself back again to her own domicil,
even if she had double the care she now
complains
about.
Nor I either, said the double-tongued
Fanny. I do so wonder, she continued,
she can persist in such a scheme! Mercy on
us, Mr. Barclay! I only wish you could have
seen the accommodations offered us this
morning
.
The room which Polly occupies is as
far superior to any lodging-room we have seen
as you can imagine. And then, the terms are
so exorbitant; why, instead of economizing
by boarding, it does seem to me it costs double.
I am sure I had no idea of the sums charged
for such indifferent rooms: my only wonder
will be hereafter, why, instead of failing, as so
many boarding-house keepers do, they do not
grow rich and retire with handsome fortunes.
But, said Mr. Barclay, you do not
realize
how great are the expenses of this class of
people. They frequently begin in debt, have
large and expensive families to educate, and
then so many wasteful servants and so many
appetites to cater for, that, adding the above
enumeration to a heavy rent in an eligible part
of the city, I rather wonder as many get along
as do.
But their names are legion, said Fanny;
and forthwith she drew out her memoranda,
upon which were inscribed twelve names.
With three of these our readers have already
formed a slight acquaintance.
Mr. Barclay, although somewhat versed in
Fanny's manuvres, did not quite understand
her. He did not suppose that two sets of
opinions
directly opposed to each other were in her
expressions, for he did not know all she had
said to Mrs. Barclay.
The afternoon of this day was cheerless
enough. Mrs. Barclay had a sick headache,
Fanny felt dissatisfied with her labors, little
Fan was peevish, Sally had gone out, and Polly
was all in confusion in the kitchen.
I hope you are not going to give up at the
very commencement of the game, cousin,
said Fanny. I beg of you, don't let your
husband
think you are repentant before you
begin
;
keep up good courage; that alone will
drive away the headache, and, if the sun shines
to-morrow, we will try again our fortunes. I
suspect we have made the worst selection on
my list to-day. At any rate, I don't feel at all
discouraged.
The next day came with its sunshine, and
seemed to inspire our friends with renewed
D
zeal. They took a turn in another part of the
city. But, patient reader, did you ever
literally
hunt for a boarding-place? If you are
a bachelor, it may be you found one tolerably
pleasant; if a lone woman, perhaps some
vacant
room looked inviting; if a school miss
in your teens, some parlor well warmed, with
its accommodations all at your service, might
strike your fancy as a pleasant home; if a
newly-married pair, who are desirous of
avoiding
too many expenses, you may find a
boarding-house quite congenial to your new
existence; but can you point me to a family,
surrounded with every convenience, whose
circumstances
warrant not only comforts, but
luxuries
;
whose children have ever felt free to
roam in every apartment; whose
accommodations
conveniences, and privileges combine
every thing we denominate a good home,
and did you ever know such a family to find
what they called a pleasant boarding-house?
Was there not something wrong in the location,
something disagreeable in the inmates,
something
,
in one word, at variance with their
happiness
?
And do you inquire how our friends
succeeded
to-day? Little better than yesterday.
They found, out of six upon Miss Fanny's
catalogue
,
but two tolerably decent rooms, and
these were at such a distance from Mr.
Barclay's
business as to make them quite out of
the question. Fanny gave up her
memorandum
and had recourse to the newspaper; there,
in glaring letters, were advertised, Good board
for a man and his wife, without children, may
be obtained in H Avenue. And, in
another
column, Board, with furnished apartments,
for a small family, may be found in a quiet,
yet central part of the city. Address box 380,
post-office.
To this address a note was soon dispatched;
and having, in their conceptions, found a
pleasant
home at last, after many fruitless efforts,
Mrs. Barclay and Fanny are at house 39
street, to ascertain particulars. The
landlord
himself answered their inquiries at the
door. Yes, he had rooms, and good ones
too. Sit down a minute, and he would show
them. It so happened they were ushered into
the dining-room, where was a long table, upon
which was a soiled cloth, some cheap dishes,
and a few dingy doilies at about one half the
plates. Don't let us wait, said Mrs.
Barclay
,
for the man to return; but Fanny had
some curiosity which she was anxious to
gratify
.
Soon the landlord, in slippers, made
signals
to them to follow him. Sundry pitchers
stood at the head of the stairs, a female was
sweeping them down, regardless of dust or dirt,
and brooms and brushes hedged up the way!
but, clearing somewhat dexterously the way
at the head of the second flight of stairs, he
threw open two doors, the rooms which were
just vacated. They had been occupied by
three representatives to our general court; but
the landlord remarked, as they preferred a
tavern, he was suited, if they were.
And what are your terms, sir? said Fanny.
Why, I want to get ten dollars; but, as it
is late in the season, I would let these two
rooms for eight to you, ladies.
Some slight demurring took place here
about keeping a servant, for Fanny said she
was determined the old fellow should think
she was somebody; and much pleased with
their adventure, our friends again found
themselves
at home.
I declare, said Hepsy Barclay, if we had
not advertised our furniture, I would keep
house till spring.
Pshaw! nonsense! said Fanny; if you
can do no better, you can go to some hotel till
you do find a place.
It would be as wearying in detail as it was
in actual suffering to enumerate the variety
of houses our friends visited to procure board.
Mean while, the day for the auction
approached
,
and still no place was secured.
D 2
CHAPTER V.
The
sale of Barclay's furniture was the
subject of a good deal of conversation among
the circle in which they visited. Every body
seemed apprised of the fact, and the ladies
pretty generally gave Mrs. Barclay a call.
At this particular time, these interruptions
were sad annoyances. And, then, the
questionings
and opinions which almost every
friend felt at liberty to give were very far
from producing a comfortable frame of mind
in Mrs. Barclay. There are people in this
world who support a sort of personal dignity
and can so diffuse their own self-esteem as to
awe or intimidate the curious from any minute
interrogations; but, unluckily, Hepsy Barclay
was not one of this number.
Scarcely would any of her particular friends
get fairly seated in the drawing-rooms, ere an
exclamation might be overheard something
like this: What magnificent parlors these are
for a party! How can Mrs. Barclay bear to
vacate such a house! I wonder her husband
don't know better! She is foolish enough to
board! Surely she never will be contented,
let her go where she may!
All the above remarks would transpire while
Mrs. Barclay was arranging her hair or dress,
previous to coming into the presence of her
acquaintances, for they were not all friends.
Sally, the nursery woman, was sure to be
detained
long enough either in putting back a
stray chair or adjusting the folds of a curtain,
although she often made it look more awry;
but her object was to hear and fully report
to Fanny and Mrs. Barclay all she heard,
and sometimes what she did not hear. This
should serve as a hint to such ladies as are
prone to indulge in random remarks in the
houses of those they visit.
This nursery woman was a great injury to
Mrs. Barclay. Her practice was to take out
little Fanny for an airing every pleasant
morning; and, as she was acquainted with
some of Mrs. Barclay's friends, having long
been in the family, they often used to say to
her as they left Mrs. Barclay's house, Sally,
you must come in, and bring little Fanny to
see my little girl or boy. This invitation was
sure to be accepted, and sorry am I to record,
that, in many instances, Sally was really more
welcome than her mistress, as more
information
concerning family affairs was divulged by
her. Since the advertisement of the sale,
little Fanny had taken an unusual number
of airings, and made sundry visits to the
little brothers and sisters, whose mothers did
not fail to make many inquiries as to the future
plans of Mr. and Mrs. Barclay. This
eavesdropping
woman was sure to remark, People
don't know all the troubles in a family unless
they live in it. Poor Mr. Barclay has a great
deal to endure. I know it is not becoming in
me to expose the secrets of a family, but we
have strange work at our house sometimes.
Perhaps the ear into which these words were
uttered would not be fully satiated until some
farther revelation was made, and this was an
easy matter to obtain by simply saying, You
need not fear I shall ever quote your remarks,
Sally. In this way, not only Mrs. Barclay
had suffered, but many other unsuspecting
families. The children often get an airing
at the expense of their mother's characters!
But it is time we look in upon Mrs. Barclay
and her cousin. As we remarked, they were
every morning filled with company; but from
no one could any information respecting a
good boarding place be derived, save old Miss
Widdifield, a maiden lady, who had
boarded
some thirty years, and had by this time,
as she shrewdly observed, learned how to
live. She informed our friends of a splendid
establishment, of which they had never heard.
It was kept by Mrs. Bates, widow of the late
Lieutenant Bates in the United States service.
This lady had vacant roomsplenty of them;
and, continued Miss Widdifield, as she
thumped
on her silver snuffbox, preparatory to the
information she was about to give, Mind ye,
Mrs. Barclay, I don't recommend this house,
for I know nothing for or against it. I only
know it is very pleasantly situated, right
opposite
to me; and yesterday there was a great
moving out there. Miss Johnson, my
landlady
,
says they have a great deal of this `
moving
out business' going on there. We reckon
they charge too high, and perhaps don't keep
so good a table; but, then, our surmises are
nothing; for you know, Mrs. Barclay, these
boarding-house women sometimes say more
about one another than they raly know.
At any rate, said Fanny, turning to
Mrs. Barclay, we can go and see for
ourselves
.
Well, my dears, continued old Miss
Widdifield
,
why won't you go over now with me;
for I should like despert well to see how they
do look inside. You know it is a kind of
satisfaction
to a lone woman, who sits all day
looking
straight across the street, to know how
they look behind the curtains; for, bless me,
they never raise a curtain there, only when
the man sweeps the parlors.
But you think, Miss Widdifield, it is a
`genteel house?' inquired Mrs. Barclay.
Bless you, child, yes! I am afraid there
is too much fashion; more fashion than food,
Miss Johnson says; but, la! as I said
before
,
she is a woman that is dreadful apt to
talk.
In the midst of this conversation Mr. and
Mrs. Bond were announced. Old Miss
Widdifield
put up her snuffbox, tightened her light
sable tippet, and spoke a low word to Mrs.
Barclay, to go over in the afternoon, and be
sure and call for her; all of which was
immediately
agreed upon.
The arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Bond, who,
although
they had lived within speaking
distance
ever since Mrs. Barclay had inhabited
her new house, yet had never called, put her
curiosity to the test. She was evidently much
disconcerted; but Mr. Bond soon put her at
ease, by remarking he had conversed with Mr.
Barclay since the advertisement of his
furniture
,
and finding he was about surrendering
his house, he had asked permission of him to
look over it a little; and, if she had no
objection
,
he would do so.
Mrs. Barclay now felt irritated that her
husband
had said nothing to her upon the
subject
;
however, like a prudent woman, she
suppressed
the above fact, and simply inquired of
them if they thought of renting it, and
resuming
housekeeping. An affirmative answer
being
given, and the premises having been duly
examined and admired by Mrs. Bond, together
with repeated exclamations concerning the
spacious closets, the chambers connecting
with one another, the bathing-room, and
the fine prospect from the cupola, she could
not close her visit without wondering how
Mrs. Barclay could think of giving up so fine
an establishment and go to board.
Hush! my dear, said Mr. Bond; by the
time you assume Mrs. Barclay's cares you
may sing a different song.
And thereby lose your health, Mr. Bond,
you may add, said Mrs. Barclay.
I understand it all, said Bond, significantly.
And so he did; for Barclay and Bond had
talked confidentially more than an hour that
very morning.
After Mr. and Mrs. Bond had left, Fanny
and Mrs. Barclay adjourned to the nursery,
and, in the presence of Sally, began to reflect
upon Mr. Barclay's conduct in not giving them
information, which he must have known, viz.,
that Bond and his wife were desirous of hiring
the house.
And I think, interrupted Fanny, a part,
or all the furniture, too; for did you notice
how very observing they were; how intently
they looked upon the drawing-room carpets,
and the girandoles, and curtains? and then,
when she would touch him, thinking I did not
see, he would nod; and once I heard him say,
`Don't make any remarks, my dear!' That,
said Fanny, shrewdly, was, I suppose,
because
he hoped to get the articles cheap.
E
I don't care for that, Fanny, said Mrs.
Barclay; if I can but get as good a
boarding-place
as they leave, they may have my
furniture
and take my cares; and didn't you
notice
,
cousin, Mr. Bond's remark: `When you
have assumed all Mrs. Barclay's cares, wife,
you may sing a different song?'
I did, said Fanny; but, Hepsy, I did not
like it; it seemed to me he spoke ironically.
I don't think so, sighed Mrs. Barclay.
In the midst of this conversation Mr.
Barclay
entered.
CHAPTER VI.
What
success, ladies, to-day? inquired
Mr. Barclay, as he tossed up little Fan in
the air.
You had better ask, husband, I should
think, `Why didn't you tell me Bond and his
wife were coming to examine the premises?'
then we should have been in better order about
house. The kitchen was a scene of confusion;
for Polly had just emptied the cupboards to
clean the tin-ware; and my chamber was filled
with trumpery that I left when I cleaned out
that great chest; and the boys' room was a
sight to behold! If you had only told us they
were coming, things would have looked
differently
,
I assure you.
Poor woman, she did not know a good
house-keeper
never need have an untidy-looking
house.
How could I tell you what I did not know
myself? said Mr. Barclay, in a pleasant tone.
The truth is, I met Bond in State-street this
morning, and, like every body that knows me,
he inquired if I was about breaking up
house-keeping
;
if I intended to rent or sell my house;
and remarked, in either case he should like to
avail himself of the opportunity to purchase or
hire it. I told him I should rent it; that more
than a dozen applicants were on my
memoranda
now. `Then,' said he, `put me first
among them; for, ever since my wife has been
apprised of your vacating your house, she has
bored me incessantly to hire or buy it.'
And how much do you ask for the rent?
inquired Fanny. Mrs. B. never meddled with
such matters.
I told him, said Mr. B., I thought it
would command a thousand dollars, but he
should have it, being a friend, with a small
family, for nine hundred and the taxes. He
came immediately over to inspect it, and the
rest you know about. But tell me, have you
yet seen a place where you would like to
board? I have kept pretty still thus far, as
you know; but when I get so far as to leave
my old home, I must think about getting a
new one; and I was going to give you, Mrs.
Barclay and Fanny, but one more day to
perambulate
the streets in search of a place, and
then, if you find none, I shall feel obliged to
take the matter in hand myself. Bond says
he thinks we can take the rooms he leaves.
How should you like them, wife?
Mrs. Barclay hopped out of her chair, and
dancing up to her husband, only said, Do
get them. You know how often I have
envied
Mrs. Bond her pleasant window and easy
enjoyment.
But, said Fanny, old Miss Widdifield
has a place in view. Mrs. Bates, opposite her,
she says, has a splendid establishment, and we
are going to see that this afternoon.
Very well, said Barclay, look all you
want to. I wish Hepsy to be fully satisfied;
for as it is, in homely phrase, `a dish of her
E 2
own cooking,' I will not throw an ingredient
into it to which she has an aversion.
After dinner the two cousins proceeded to
call for Miss Widdifield. The good old lady
inhabited a second-rate boarding-house, and
quite an ordinary room up two flights of stairs.
Mrs. Barclay thought of her remark, she had
learned how to live, as very inappropriate;
but she was very cordial in her reception, and
highly gratified with the prospect of her call
on Mrs. Bates. And now we will conduct
you, kind reader, to the interior of Mrs. Bates's
fashionable establishment. A man-servant,
of course, bowed the ladies into the
drawing-room
,
asked for their card, and being
informed
that their call was on business, withdrew to
summon the lady of the house into their
presence
.
And here was indeed splendor! Mrs.
Barclay's
drawing-rooms contained nothing more
elegant; indeed, her ottomans, lounges, and
window seats were not so modern. No
wonder, thought Miss Widdifield, they
never
raise the curtains; the light of day would
injure such delicate fabrics! While the
ladies
remained patiently seated, gazing upon
the splendid paintings which decorated the
walls, the servant returned, saying, Madam
Bates would wait on them as soon as she had
finished her game at
bagatelle
with General
Frazer!
At length she appeared. She was most
queenly in figure, attractive in manner, and
fashionable in dress, and listened to the
purport
of their business in a most deferential
manner, and with an easy,
nonchalant
air.
She informed her guests that she had just now
rather an unusual number of vacancies, as one
of the United States ships had just gone out of
port, and many of the officers, although they
nominally lived on board the ship, yet hired
rooms, and took most of their food at her table.
Old Miss W. here made the untimely remark
that she supposed she lived high, then, for all
the officers she ever knew were dreadful fond
of good living. Fanny wished the old lady
farther.
All the luxuries of the market I
generally
procure, ladies, and of course charge a
price correspondent. I likewise keep plenty
of servants; for I once boarded myself, and
never did my poor husband find a house with
a sufficient number of what he called `useful
appendages.' I have just procured a French
cook, a man who is most thoroughly
acquainted
with his business, and serves us with the
finest soups I ever tasted. He has two
assistant
women, who go and come at his bidding;
and I believe I may say no better
chamber-maids
ever were found. Indeed, ladies, I am
relieved of nearly all care; but my expenses
are enormous. But I will not inflict such a
disagreeable feature in one's living upon you,
but, if you please, I will conduct you over my
vacant apartments, and I am sure you can find
just the rooms you may desire, for `I have
large, small, and between ones,' as
Commodore
Gates frequently remarks.
The ladies followed, and often cast toward
each other very meaning looks as they did so.
Here was first exhibited a large, very large
drawing-room, finished and furnished nearly
as tastefully as the one underneath.
Adjoining
this was Midshipman Andrew's private
room, carefully locked; but a cough
announced
that the gentleman was within it. Over
the entry was a large unoccupied chamber or
parlor, as you pleased to make it: it had been
used for both. Madam B. had a splendid
French bedstead and marble washstand, which
she furnished, if requested (the property of a
surgeon in one of the steam-ships, but which
he permitted her to use as her own in his
absence
).
All my gentlemen, she remarked,
en passant
, are very obliging, and, she
added, excellent paymasters in the end,
although
I often suffer some inconveniences in
waiting. Opposite this room, upon the other
side of the house, was another, of the same
dimensions
,
similarly furnished; fine closet-room
was very common likewise; and above all
these apartments were six more nearly as
eligible
,
but all unoccupied!
Mrs. Barclay expressed great surprise at
these vacancies; so did Fanny; but old Miss
Wdid more. She quaintly remarked her
surprise how any body could get a living in an
empty house, when they pretended to keep
boarders; a sentence Madam Bates appeared
not to hear. She seemed to have a
convenient
deafness; and no treatise upon that
delicate
organ, the ear, ever yet prescribed for this
disease.
Having shown all the vacancies, she
added
,
And now, ladies, just take a peep in my
dining-room. It was a spacious room
indeed
.
A long table, which was folded again
and again, as her family decreased, making
desertions more visible, stood in the center;
upon it was the
bagatelle
board, and in a room
leading beyond, Fanny declared was a
billiard-table
.
You see we keep very comfortable here,
ladies, continued Madam Bates. Behind her,
upon the commode, stood two decanters,
labeled
Sherry, Madeira.
This was too much for old Lady W,
who was a thorough temperance woman. She
burst out,
Bless me, Miss Bates, here is a sight I haven't
seen for years! Do you furnish liquors on your
table?
The cousins wished the old lady in California.
Oh, replied madam, I lay no restrictions
upon commanding officers; they are unused
to obedience, and, of course, they board where
every thing is made easy and agreeable.
Temperance
is a very good thing, but a glass of
wine now and then never hurts me. I do not,
however, usually keep my wines in quite so
conspicuous a place; but Colonel
And here the man-servant announced a box
had arrived, directed to Madam Bates,
Avenue.
The ladies ought here to have withdrawn,
but really they were entertained, and so
prolonged
their stay beyond all the bounds of
etiquet
.
Bring it here, Sam, ordered the hostess,
and quickly open it; I can not imagine its
contents.
And, sure enough, it is a headdress, and a
very tasteful one too, with Commodore Shaler's
compliments, and inviting Mrs. Bates to
partake
of an evening's amusement at the theater,
with a bill at the bottom of the box announcing
the play, Romeo and Juliet, to conclude with
the laughable comedy, Three Weeks after
Marriage.
You see, ladies, a specimen here of my
boarders! they are whole-souled gentlemen!
This commodore is a very generous man. He
has only been with me a month or so; has a
beautiful wife in England; and so I feel at
liberty
to accept his attentions, as, she added,
you know no remarks will be made.
Dear me, I don't know about that, said
old Miss W, for she would speak, she
said, after she came out.
Thus, an unwarrantably long call having
been made, our ladies, promising to call again,
left Madam Bates.
Old Miss W had hardly stepped upon
the sidewalk ere she commenced with plenty
of comments; but the decanters seemed to be
the burden of her song, and the explanation in
those, she thought, she found in Madam Bates's
volubility. She deeply regretted she had
spoken of this place to Mrs. Barclay; but, as
she had thereby looked behind the curtains,
she comforted herself she had done no harm;
for Mrs. Barclay said, Nothing on earth would
induce her to board in such a house.
And with this day closed Mrs. Barclay's
and Fanny's hunt for a fashionable
boarding-house
.
Very few would have persevered so
long in looking, but curiosity prompted Fanny,
and a desire to get a good home in a genteel
house, Mrs. Barclay. They returned home,
and narrated the particulars, as above
described
,
at Madam Bates's, to Mr. Barclay.
And what did you say the woman's name
was? he inquired.
Bates.
Bates? Bates? Why, that is the very
F
woman Bond was talking about this morning.
She has just gone into bankruptcy.
What a comment upon a style without
any means to carry it on! said Fanny.
It was now left for them to secure Bond's
rooms when he vacated them. Having
examined
them, and found them rather eligible,
compared with those they had seen, Fanny
and Mrs. Barclay concluded to take them
without
farther comment, for a beginning must be
made.
CHAPTER VII.
It
was now the day before the auction.
Clerks were very busy assorting in lots the
whole contents of the house; for Mr. Bond,
although he had rented the house, and desired
much of the furniture, concluded to take it at
auction prices, alledging that the auctioneer
would thereby get his commission, and
bystanders
would not complain of unfair dealing.
Mrs. Barclay had removed to her new
boarding-house
sundry articles which, from
conversation
with Mrs. Bond, she found would be
necessary; but how it could be she would
need a copper saucepan, a small tea-kettle, two
or three flat-irons, and other unnameable
articles
,
she could not divine! Experience gives
us knowledge we never otherwise learn.
It was indeed a busy day at Barclay's!
Mrs. Bond was talking with Polly; and
Fanny's
inference was, that she was retaining her
services, for she heard Polly observe, And
sure two dollars a week is small pay for a head
cook; in boarding-houses they give three;
but, bating the privilege of going to the Church
of the Holy Cross on Sundays, and keeping
Lent, &c., I will take what I told you.
Oh, that's it, said Mrs. Barclay. Mrs.
Bond did ask me about Polly, and Sally said
she inquired of her as to her capability.
True, she did inquire of Sally, and she gave
her a character indeed: She was cross;
wanted nobody in the kitchen; and a saint
could not live with her without quarreling.
Other things, too, were narrated respecting
conversations between Fanny and Mrs.
Barclay
about Mrs. Bond's manuvring to get
the house, and that they should pay for what
they bought, &c., and it was probably this
circumstance that induced Mr. Bond to buy
every thing at auction.
The day of sale has now arrived! A long
red flag proclaims the event to every
passerby
.
No permission to see the articles the day
before has been given; therefore, at an early
hour, the crowd have gathered. It has been
previously agreed that Fanny and Mrs.
Barclay
shall have a seat in a retired corner, and
watch the proceedings. Some sensitive ladies
would not have desired this; for when the
actual
knocking off of long-prized and valued
articles takes place, and that irrevocable word
gone is uttered, they would much prefer to be
among the missing. But Mrs. Barclay had
no such feelings. Was she not in ill health?
Had not the care of these very articles worn
her out? Was she not going now to live at
ease in a boarding-house? Surely, then, the
novelty of the sale was very agreeable.
The crowd increases every moment. The
sale has commenced in the kitchen, where,
among the number, is seen old Polly, with her
large, frilled Irish cap, starched for the
occasion
,
and a white apron, only worn when her
cooking is done. And there, too, are the
sisters
,
Jemima and Dorothy Witherspoon, who
keep boarders that have no children! They
F 2
are standing beside that very coffee-biggin
they spoke about. Let us see if they buy it.
Twenty-five cents! says the auctioneer;
only twenty-five cents! Why, it cost six
times the money. Wedgewood's make
warranted
to make good coffee. Whose bid do I
hear? Gentlemen, let those ladies passit
has now reached one dollar, and Miss Jemima
utters the sharp major key-note, 1 25
1 30 do I hear? Oh, madam, it is your bid
still; 1 404550!and still Jemima's bid
upon herself!going at 1 50!going, going,
gone to Miss J. Witherspoon for 1 50, and
too cheap at that! says the man of the
hammer
.
Many of the culinary articles are put to Mr.
Bond; indeed, Polly thinks there is quite
enough left for her to clane. Now let us
peep in the drawing-rooms. Close by that
gold-banded China sits that tawdry, old French
boarding-house keeper, Madame Gori, her
black sunken eyes resting, as if fixed in a fit,
upon the French coffee-set! Fanny and Mrs.
Barclay are inspecting her winter's dress:
she wears a cloak lined with ermine upon the
inside; but, evidently, the moths occupied it
last summer; her hat is filled with rag roses,
feathers, and buckles; and Fanny wonders
what she does with that huge turban when she
wears a bonnet; for she thinks she discovers
in the frill an old acquaintance. Poor woman!
Don't laugh; she only has a peculiar taste,
unlike ours, in dress!
And who is not here? There are Bishop
C and his lady; Commodore D and
his daughter, who, report says, is on the eve
of marriage to her majesty's mail-carrier; and
Esquire Thorn and his maiden sister; old
Parson G, and that attendant lady always
at his side; besides the middling, and, if one
may judge by appearances, some of the lower
and lowest classes. A lame man, of very
ordinary
appearance, seems to be much relied
on by the auctioneer as being ready to bid. It
is the second-hand dealer in  street.
He always buys, although his rooms are
overrunning
now with every kind of article in the
housekeeping line; but these articles being
choice, are not so desirable to him.
The girandoles are bought by Mr. Bond
so are the imperial carpets and the mirrors.
This creates some distrust among a portion of
the company. That's Barclay's `by-bidder,'
reaches the auctioneer's ears; and now he is
forced to explain.
Gentlemenmy address is not to ladies,
for they are not so jealousthere is no `
bybidder'
here. The highest bidder is the owner,
be he who he may. Mr. Bond has rented this
house, and is ready to buy at a fair price what
he wants for his future use. Mr. Barclay
surrenders
all, and quits these premises
to-morrow
,
on account of the `ill health' of his lady.
That was an impudent speech, which ought
not to have been publicly made, and Barclay
felt it even more than his wife, although all
eyes were directed to her who had ever
looked
upon her before; and some wag remarked,
Better keep out of such a crowd, if she is very
ill; she may faint; but people who will
expose
themselves to ill-natured remarks can
generally have an opportunity to hear them in
an auction-room.
The India poy tables are now under the
hammer. These light, tasteful, and useful
articles
are much in vogue, and desired by
sundry
people. A smart bidding is carried on
between Bishop C and the commodore;
but the former gains the prize at about twice
the original cost; his lady protests she never
saw any half as cheap before!
At length the China is offered; but first
comes that Britannia venison-dish. Colonel
Gardner now gives a significant wink to Miss
J. Witherspoon; her sharp voice offers
seventy-five
cents! It thus stands; nobody wants
it; and, in beseeching tones, the auctioneer
inquires if nobody eats venison among this
assembly; if so, he calls on them to speak.
An elegant lady in rich attire, reclining upon
a gentleman's arm, who wears an epaulette,
bids one dollar; and it is hers! Jemima looks
awe-struck, so commanding is her appearance;
and the name is given by the gentleman, which
the lady whispers him to announce, as
Madam
Bates! Old Miss Widdifield here pulled
out her snuffbox, and, Fanny said, actually
sneezed, as she drew up a much larger
quantity
than usual.
It is now eleven o'clock, and the piano is
announced, the seraphim having been
withdrawn
.
That is not Barclay's piano, said
a by-stander, but one that I have seen in two
auctions before to-day. The truth was told.
Mrs. Barclay had moved hers to her
boarding-house
,
and this was sent in by the maker,
with Barclay's consent, to make the sale just
as advertised. Beware, friend, of purchasing
an instrument at a public auction. It is said that
first-rate articles are seldom thus sacrificed!
No bid satisfactory was made upon this
instrument
,
and, of course, it lies over to another sale!
Bond has the pictures, excepting two or three
choice pieces, which Barclay has removed.
The library is untouched; the door is locked.
Thus, in a few hours, is partial desolation
made visible: hand-carts and
furniture-wagons
take the places carriages have often
occupied; the flag is withdrawn, and the sale
is over. Poor Mrs. Barclay! you have
accomplished
all you purposed to do. Fanny
Jones leaves for home, and Mr. and Mrs.
Barclay, Sally, and little Fan are at board.
John and Charles Barclay are with an uncle
in the country until all things are settled.
CHAPTER VIII.
As
much as Mrs. Barclay had desired this
change, there can be no doubt that Fanny Jones
has borne her along in it, and brought it about
much sooner than it otherwise would have
been.
But she is at board; that is, she is in
rooms vacated by Mr. Bond and family. She
has taken many of their articles, such as
carpets
,
ottomans, and curtains; and they, in turn,
have hers in possession. It is now the
evening
after the sale; the first opportunity Mr.
Barclay has had to converse with his wife for
the last three weeks, when she was not
sleepy, or had Miss Fanny at her side!
Well, wife, said he, now, I suppose, you
are in expectation of much enjoyment. I hope
you will find it; but, for myself, I must confess,
I feel as old Miss Widdifield said she did at
Madam Bates's, `like a cat in a strange
garret
.'
Ain't we dreadfully compressed here for
room? and why don't we have access to this
closet, pray? Bond said he had it, and I
stipulated
for every inch of room he occupied
I'm sure I pay enough.
What do you pay? inquired Mrs.
Barclay
,
gaping; thirty dollars, I supposehey?
Yes, and twenty more at the end of it.
Why, I thought Mr. Bond paid thirty?
And so he did; but, you know, they kept
no nursery woman, and their two boys only
dined here; the rest of the time they were at
his brother's. But I must see into this door's
being locked.
Sally knew the secret; but she said nothing
till Mr. Barclay left the room to inquire about
it; for he, of late, kept Sally at a distance with
her tongue.
Her explanation, however, to Mrs. Barclay
was, that Mrs. Shortt begged Mrs. Bond not
to show this anteroom to Mrs. Barclay; for
she had an old bachelor, who occupied a room
above, and, as he was very gouty, he had
informed
G
Mrs. Shortt he should be obliged to
leave the house unless he could procure a
room upon the second story. The day before
the Barclays went he was moved down. It
may be inferred the old man knew this trick;
for, however loud the knocking at the door,
there came no answer.
Mr. Barclay was gone some time, and
returned
in no very good humor.
I do believe, said he, as he thrust the poker
to the very bottom of the grate, that these
women who keep boarders are the greatest
`spongers' in the world.
Don't talk so, husband; Mrs. Shortt seems
very kind. Sally, do run down and ask her
to send me up a cup of strong hyson tea, a slice
of toast, and a bit of cake, and some preserves,
if she has any on the table.
Mr. Barclay saw it was no use to talk, so
he took little Fan, and played a game of
bo-peep with her, and, soon after, took his
tea below among the strange group.
Madam Shortt was a very, very particular
woman. She used to boast that she always
began with boarders as she could hold out; and,
it seems, she began with a vengeance with the
Barclays. Sally did her message in a very
proper manner, and even expressed Mrs.
Barclay's
regrets (which she did not send) that
she was prevented by a severe headache from
appearing at the table, and she wished her tea
in her room.
Give my compliments to Mrs. Barclay,
said Madam Shortt, and tell her it is in direct
violation of all the rules of my house to send
food to the rooms of the inmates; that if
people
are too sick to come to the table, we
suppose
them too sick to eat, and, of course, then
they provide a nurse; but, considering she is
a new-comer, I will to-night let you take the
waiter from the kitchen, and carry it to Mrs.
Barclay's room.
Sally was thunder-struck, but did as she was
desired, and succeeded only in procuring a
slice of dry toast, and a piece of very dry
sponge cake; but, as she delivered Madam
Shortt's message first, neither the food nor
tea relished, and Mrs. Barclay's head really
ached worse than before. But she resolved
not to complain. Sally took her tea with the
domestics, and a poor meal she found it;
little
Fan had her tumbler of milk and crackers,
and went to sleep. Would that we could, like
tired children, drop into sweet forgetfulness,
when vexed and tired with all about us!
In the course of the first evening, Mr.
Barclay
remarked to his wife that he believed they
had a real Tartar to deal with, and she had
better prepare herself to get along as smoothly
as possible; for, said he, Bond and his
wife will laugh well in their sleeves, if we
should get up a quarrel to begin with, when
they have boarded here for years. But I tell
you one thing, wife, and that is, for breakfast,
you had better equip yourself to appear at the
table, for there are great inquiries about you. I
heard a remark from a large, portly woman,
just as I entered the front parlor to teanot
being perceived, I supposewhich, I think,
referred
to you: `That's right, madam; I would
not do it; if to-night, you may to-morrow, and
it is setting a bad precedent.'
What would you put on for a morning
dress, husband? I meant Fanny should have
brought me something suitable.
Wear just what you please, Hepsy, only
don't dress too much. The most genteel
ladies
,
in the morning, never wear any thing
better
than a calico or de lain, I believe.
Hadn't Sally better run over and ask Mrs.
Bond what is proper to wear?
Don't be so foolish, wife; it is of no sort
of consequence. There will be more
important
matters, I fear, soon to talk about, unless
we go very even-handed.
And, sure enough, the first night was a
trying
one to Barclay. Scarcely would he get
in a drowsy state, approaching sleep, ere a
terrible
groan, sometimes accompanied by an
oath, would burst upon his ear! As he
listened
,
a low, indistinct murmuring could be heard,
as if two were in close consultation. Thus it
G
continued for some hours; when Barclay, who
was somewhat of a nervous temperament, and
probably, at this time, looking back as well as
forward to little domestic happiness, sprang
from his bed, lighted his lamp, and had recourse
to a book.
Mrs. Barclay, perfectly undisturbed, slept
quietly till awakened by that unusual sound to
her ears, the gong, at its first summons to
prepare for breakfast.
Oh dear! was her first exclamation, can
that be for breakfast? I'm sure I never can rise
at this early hour. Mr. Barclay, how came
you up so early?
Up! said Barclay; I might as well have
been in a cotton-factory all night as listening
to such groans and oaths as came from that
room.
I'm sure I heard nothing, husband.
CHAPTER IX.
Let
us take a peep at Madam Shortt's
breakfast-room and its inmates. That old
gentleman at the head of the table is Captain
Ingersoll, and the fat, portly lady at his side
is his wife. The old man was formerly in the
China trade, and can tell you all about the
opium and tea in the Celestial Empire. But
he knows more of the Chinese than
Americans
.
Next to them sits Madam Bounce, the
widow of an Episcopal bishop, who died in
England some years since. She emigrated
to America to ascertain some facts relative to
her husband's right in certain real estate he
possessed, which was sold, and the proceeds
withheld on account of some defect in the title.
She came over highly recommended to all
the right reverend bishops, rectors, and
deacons
,
full half a score of them, and proudly
does she plume herself upon her ancestry.
Don't speak to her unless you are of noble
extraction
.
She may be civil, but she will show
you she is not to be familiarly treated! Beyond
her is the honorable senator from  county.
He is engrossed in conversation about some
bills which he thinks, if they go through the
House, will find a nonconcurrence in the
Senate. The gentleman with whom he is in
such earnest confab is Simon Peters, a
gentleman
from his native town, and by whom he
was introduced at Madam Shortt's. That
maiden lady, who seems to carry the
impression
in her countenance that she is gazed upon
and admired, is Miss Sylvia Dexter, a
Sabbath-school
teacher, and instructress in sundry
ornamental
branches. She is a second cousin to
the landlady; is probably considered in her
board, as she arranges with great precision
Madam Shortt's center-table. And just
beyond
her is a sort of facetious fellow they call
Mr. Caleb Flash. He is a broker, and
greatly amuses the whole set of boarders by
descriptions of those who have been duped by
buying in fancy stocks just as they get a
downward tendency. He is now narrating
to Mr. Holman, a lawyer of some ability, a
pitiable
case of a man who thus invested. Take
care, Caleb, the very man you are conversing
with comes in for a part of your wit; for he
was drawn into a snare by speculating too
freely a month ago! Beyond them sit Robert
Barclay and wife, with whom our readers are
familiarly acquainted. But hark! there is a
great commotion; sometimes it sounds like a
heavy footstep, and then a clumping noise, as if
a stick of wood was falling. A man-servant
swings the door wide open, and Mr.
Bumblefoot
is on hand! This is the identical man
who swore and groaned all night, and thus
prevented
Barclay from getting any rest.
In a remarkably pleasant tone sounds the
Good morning, Mr. Bumblefoot, from Madam
Shortt. How did you rest, sir? You seem
unusually lame this morning. Is that
rheumatic
affection in your foot again at work?
inquired the hostess, very plaintively; and still
more modulating her voice to its finest
compass
,
Pray be seated, Mr. Bumblefoot, in this
arm-chair; I anticipated you were not so well
this morning; and, Judith, warm that cushion,
and draw that chair toward Mr. Bumblefoot
that he may put his foot in it (thought Mrs.
Barclay, this is more attention than I asked for
last night). And now, Judith, run to the
front cellar and bring up a pint bottle of cider
marked upon the cork B., the same kind you
got last night, Judith.
Yes, ma'am.
I am sorry you feel so ill, sir.
So am I too, gruffly answered the old
man. It has been a night of torment to me:
Sam can attest that, for he has been heating
flannels all night.
While Judith is gone for the bottle, the old
man, looking at the table rather sharply, is
attracted
by the new couple nearly opposite to
him. Is that the Mr. Berkly, Miss Shortt,
you said was `moving in' yesterday?
Excuse me, sir, for not introducing you.
Mr. Barclay, this is Mr. Bumblefoot, a boarder
of long standing in my house. Mrs. Barclay,
Mr. Bumblefoot.
There are times when one is forced to be
civil, and so it was here; for Barclay really
felt indignant at the imposition of the
landlady
,
and the disquiet the old man had
occasioned
him; but it must borne.
Berkly! Berkly! said the old fellow, in
a coarse, gruff tone; I want to ask you if
your father was not a hatter down in Liberty
Square?
No, sir, I claim no acquamtance or
knowledge
of such a man, dryly answered
Barclay
.
Well, I knew another Berkly (and here
he twitched his great foot), a man that kept
under Faneuil Hall market.
Oh, Mr. Bumblefoot, you have mistaken
the name, said Miss Sylvia; it is Barclay,
not Berkly.
Mr. Barclay nodded.
Now, Judith, reach the tumbler and
corkscrew
,
and draw up the stand, and I will take
my breakfast here, where it is warmer, said
old Bumblefoot.
Breakfast was dispatched, the table cleared,
and still Madam Shortt was attending the old
man. Sally and little Fan are sent to the
lobby, a sort of closet, to get their morning
meal. But little Fan cries to go home;
persists she will not eat; and Mrs. Shortt opens
the door and informs Sally that she can have
no crying children in her house.
Barclay is coming down stairs, and hears it
all. He is not a passionate man, as my
readers
know; but, having had no rest, and feeling
imposed upon, and finding his child is to be
driven off, his nature is stirred. With a bold
front, he inquires at once of Mrs. Shortt if
she excludes all children from her table;
adding
,
he intended his little girl should, in
future
,
sit in her high chair, and take her food at
the time her parents did.
Madam colored above her forehead, and
burst out, Mr. Barclay, I never have found
so unreasonable a man as you, sir, in all my
experience of keeping boarders. Scarcely had
you set foot within my doors before you
demanded
a key to which you are no more
entitled
than the pope. Then Mrs. Barclay
wanted tea sent to her room, and now your
child is to make another fracas. Mr. Barclay,
it is a rule with me to begin as I can hold out;
and I tell you, sir, at this early stage of the
business, if you are dissatisfied, you may go
to-day; but mind ye, you shall pay a month's
board in advance. The child will never be
seen at my table, sir, with my boarders; your
lady will not have her tea sent to her room;
and you may get the key to the ante-room
when I give you leave, sir!
That's right, Miss Shortt, mumbled out old
Bumblefoot: I won't stand by you any longer
if you give up your rights. These women,
Mr. Berkly, said he, shaking his finger at
him, ought not to be imposed upon.
Mr. Barclay explained; but of what avail
is one man's tongue beside Mrs. Shortt's?
H
Barclay, however, is missing at dinner.
Madam
inquires of Mrs. Barclay if her husband
usually dines down town.
Things are not made smooth for our friends;
it is a bad beginning.
Hepsy, said Barclay, in the evening, put
on your hood, and we will run over to Bond's.
She did so. What is uppermost in our
thoughts is generally first from our lips. The
evening was, of course, spent discussing the
singularities of Madam Shortt and her
boarders
,
and much information was elicited.
You may get along, said Mrs. Bond, with
the woman, but I have my doubts. I have
borne all sorts of insults from her; but of late
she has learned better than to play the tyrant
over me. She was always meddling with my
children; sometimes was severe; and I have
known her indulgent to a fault; for `Bonny'
would do her errands, and sometimes it was
a great convenience to Mr. Bumblefoot for him
to stop at Cullen's and order a basket of
Champagne
.
And who on earth is this old Bumblefoot?
said Barclay. I really thought, at first, it
was a nickname assumed by the boarders, so
significant does it seem of his old gouty leg.
The old rascal has been a severe trial to me
thus far; for I got no rest last night for his
hideous oaths and groans.
Bond looked at his wife, and thought of the
ante-room where he had removed, but
prudently
kept silent, and for once, be it said in praise
of woman, she kept her peace too!
Old Bumblefoot is an Englishman; a real
roast-beef eater and Champagne drinker. He
gives great suppers sometimes, Barclay, and if
you want to taste some of the best wines in
the country, you had better cultivate his
acquaintance
.
He has a large property in
England
,
and came over to America some years
since to take a berth in the United States Bank.
When that went down, he made Boston his
residence, and, somehow or other, took
lodgings
at Mrs. Shortt's.
Husband, said Mrs. Bond, you seem to
have forgotten a fact that has been told more
times than you can count, that he came
passenger
with Madam Shortt's husband. Shortt
was commander of the vessel he came in.
Don't you remember Mrs. Shortt's tone when
she used to say, `Mr. Bumblefoot, if it had not
been for your generous loans, I know not what
would have become of poor me. I had not
money enough to pay for poor Thomas's
funeral
charges when he died.' The fact was,
Captain Shortt was a very intemperate man,
and was greatly involved at his decease. She
has one son, who has just gone out upon a
trading
expedition; but you will never hear her
speak of him.
But really, continued Bond, the
boarding-house
is about as good as any you will find. It
takes time, you know, to become domesticated;
but when that is done, you will enjoy Flash's
queer jokes, and old Ingersoll's sea tales, and
even Bumblefoot's pleasantry will be amusing
when he gets over this turn of the gout. But
I charge you, Barclay, don't say the word gout
before him; always call it `a rheumatic
affection
;'
for the old fellow is terribly sensitive on
this point.
You must remember, too, continued our
friend, that you labor under great
disadvantages
at board, going, as you do, from this
charming house and all its comforts. Why, I
don't suppose you could induce my wife to
leave it and again go to board if you were to
offer her a kingdom. Every thing has worked
admirably since we came here. Polly is a fine
cook, and we get along in the most
comfortable
manner. Our boys enjoy it, I assure you;
for it was a terrible cramped life to our
children
.
Barclay sighed; and Mrs. Barclay actually
had recourse to her handkerchief, for a tear
stood in her eye, notwithstanding she brought
all the trouble upon themselves.
H 2
CHAPTER X.
Three
weeks have now passed, and with
them has gone into the oblivious stream a
long catalogue of trials. Mr. Barclay is not,
as formerly, always at home in the evening;
the air-tight stove gives him a headache, and
so he visits his friends. Mrs. Barclay
sometimes
wonders he stays so late, but he tells
her, he prefers not to return till
Bumblefoot
is ensconced in bed, so annoying does he
find him. Sometimes the head clerk and he
are adjusting business at the store till a late
hour; but oftener (oh! I hate to record it) Mr.
Barclay is found in convivial parties! It has
been decided, since that interview at Bond's,
that their two boys shall remain a short time
longer out of town, for, in reality, another
boarding-house is on foot. And truly, here
may we quote the old saying, we know not
what to-morrow will bring; that to-morrow
finds the same company, as usual, assembled at
the breakfast-table, save the unaccountable
absence
of Madam Shortt and Colonel
Bumblefoot
(for madam sometimes gives the old man
this title). Miss Sylvia, however, presides
with her wonted grace; and Captain Ingersoll
seems in a high flow of spirits. Caleb thinks
he shall have an order to buy him some stock
to-day. But all at once is heard a loud rap
upon the table, and the old captain rises as if
commanding a man-of-war ship.
Fellow-messmates! he begins, I wish
you to give me your undivided attention. (All
are breathless; Caleb even puts his hand against
his ear.) We live in a world of change
(Caleb bows profoundly), and these changes
are about affecting us in a most sensible
manner
.
(Sylvia wipes her eyes.) Our
ever-to-be-respected
hostess is about entering the
holy bands of wedlock with Colonel
Bumblefoot
!
(Caleb suppresses a cough.) She
intends vacating her present position one
fortnight
from next Thursday; and, from that
day, Captain Ingersoll will succeed her as your
landlord, if you choose to put yourselves
under
his protection. He has often `doubled the
Cape,' and never wrecked a crew; and, before
he hauls into port for the last time, proposes
making one more trading voyage, if he finds a
crew!
Amen! ejaculated the bishop's widow,
no doubt forgetting herself for the moment;
but this conclusion was from her book of
Common
Prayer.
Caleb burst into a roar of laughter, and,
wishing to disguise the cause from the august
lady who provoked it, said, In short, Madam
Shortt is no more to be in our midst!
I have one word more, continued Captain
Ingersoll, which is, that Colonel Bumblefoot
desires me to make his compliments to every
member of this board, and requests the pleasure
of their company on Wednesday evening,
February
29th, at this table, the evening
previous
to Mr. and Mrs. Bumblefoot's taking
passage
in the steam-ship for Liverpool!
Then, of course, quoth Caleb, as `the
board' are invited, I am particularly so.
Wonder
how large an order I shall fill!
I suppose every body has seen and heard
the varieties of attitudes and expressions which
are called forth by an agreeable surprise; but
no imagination can do justice to Captain
Ingersoll's
announcement. After a little
deliberation
(for a breakfast is perfectly indigestible
when such emotions are felt), it is concluded
that a meeting of the aforesaid board, at
which Mr. Flash is to act the part of scribe
and moderator, shall be held at Esquire
Holman's
rooms, to see what testimonial of
respect
shall be presented to Madam Shortt, in
consideration of what Caleb calls her
shortcomings
.
Shall it be a silver cup? Not
enough can be collected. A gold watch?
Bumblefoot presented her with one yesterday.
A gold pencil? Nobody ever saw her write
a word! In short, says Mr. Flash, let
every one give as his inclination prompts; in
virtue of which resolution, I present Madam
Shortt with `Dickens's works entire,' from his
caricature of Americans to his Cricket on the
Hearth! Captain Ingersoll followed with a
Chinese smoke-pipe; and the colonel and his
other half gave a volume of Holy Writ, to be
read on the voyage. The bishop's widow
gave Remarks on Puseyism, addressed to the
Thoughtful; and thus from each one was some
little token elicited, save Barclay! His old
prejudice revived; the key, old Bumblefoot's
remarks, and his being a new boarder
exonerated
him, it was fairly agreed on all hands.
But Mrs. Barclay would not be thought
mean; and, not going out of her husband's
line of business (as he was in the cotton trade),
she presented a piece of sheeting, which,
madam
remarked, in her card of thanks, was just
the needed article! Suffice it to say, there
is more laxity now in government where
Madam
Shortt resides. Even little Fan has her
high chair at the table, and the nursery
woman
is permitted to get a little hot water from
the kitchen, without being reminded that this
will be considered an extra!
But the wedding is near at hand, thought
Mrs. Barclay; Fanny Jones must be
present
;
it would so amuse her. Of course, she
immediately dispatches a note by the omnibus,
and tells her of the strange affair, in which she
is unexpectedly obliged to quit her
boarding-house
.
And, thought she, what a
merciful
release is thus opened to us, without being
bored by our whole round of acquaintances
with, `How came you, Mrs. Barclay, to make
so short a stay at Madam Shortt's?'
Marriages
and deaths seem sometimes wisely
ordered
!
But let us hear Fanny's answer; and
if surprise has been already experienced, what
can we suppose were Mrs. Barclay's emotions
now? This is Cousin Fanny's note:
D, Feb. 12th,.
Cousin Hepsy
,
I was just at my writing-desk, dictating a
note to be sent to you, as your kind one
arrived
.
Do not think me, Cousin Hepsy, a
maniac, ranting in an untrue style, when I tell
you I had accepted an invitation to stand as
bridemaid to Madam Shortt the very day the
announcement of her marriage was made to
you! My partner (for I will tell the whole)
is Rev. Mr. Milnor, our former clergyman, now
of your city, who knew Colonel Bumblefoot
many years in England, and many since in
America; and, at his urgent request, has
consented
to stand nearest him during the
ceremony
!
But your exclamations are not over
yet. I suppose, at no very distant day, your
cousin, Fanny Jones, may sign her name as
`Fanny Milnor!' You will please
communicate
this to your good husband; and if I can
be of any service to you again in a chase for
a boarding-house, you are welcome to my
services
.
As ever,
Fanny
.
Can it be so? thought Mrs. Barclay, as
she opened the letter, re-read it, threw it down,
and read it over again. It may be, after all,
one of Fanny's hoaxes to surprise me.
But, then, she had often heard Fanny speak
of Mr. Milnor; she knew he called upon her
the last time she was in the city; that she
walked out with him; and that she told her of
his visits to a very indigent family, for whom
she intended to interest herself. Yes, said
she, I now can read it all; and she so longed
to communicate it, that forthwith she
proceeded
to her husband's counting-room. There
she found him in earnest conversation, the
conclusion
of which was, and I may depend on
it to-morrow? Every business man knows
the meaning of that sentence, and, probably,
most women too. They are portentous words!
Her husband, at the time overburdened with
cares in endeavoring to meet the payment of
some heavy notes, and oppressed at heart with
the little prospect of domestic peace before
him, did not manifest an equal surprise with
herself at the reception of the news she
carried
.
Indeed, many had observed, of late, that
Robert Barclay seemed depressed; and while
his neighbors in trade attributed it to losses
and rumors of unfortunate speculations, the
friends of Mrs. Barclay only believed it to be
I
severe domestic afflictions; that he had
sacrificed
his home, which every body knew he
warmly cherished; and, in exchange for
reciprocal
greetings of friends, he was forced
abroad to wear out existence as best he might!
But there are many things to divert Mrs.
Barclay from observing the moody silence
which her husband maintains. There is to be
a large party at Bond's; report says he is
introducing
gas into his house preparatory to the
event; there is to be the wedding, a new
boarding-house
to be procured, and Cousin Fanny is
to be married!
CHAPTER X.
It
is all over, and the whole company
waited
upon Mr. and Mrs. Bumblefoot to the ship.
Barclay alone was missing, he having deputed
the Rev. Mr. Milnor and lady to take charge
of his wife. But he has this day secured
another
house to board. It is nearer his
business
,
and the reputation of the house is good.
He is determined that John and Charles shall
be in the family with themselves; for, some
how, misgivings come over him that he has of
late neglected his parental duties; and he
reasons
that, if he is once more with his boys, the
evening fireside will present an additional
charm, as was the case in former days.
Scarcely, however, was the process of
moving again completed, before little Fan
was seized with the hooping-cough! The
nursery woman, in one of her recent calls,
exposed
her to this disease.
A bad beginning again, said Barclay;
but, as Bumblefoot is gone, it can be borne.
We will now look in upon the Barclays,
since they have begun to live at Mr. Durgin's.
Here is a plain man and his wife, the former
of whom was an early friend of Barclay's; but
he has run down in business, and set up a
boarding establishment. Our friends have
good accommodations at a fair price; the
children
are all about them, and permitted to eat
at the same table with their parents; but (there
always is a but in a boarding-house) they
can not find a sufficient number of boarders to
meet their expenses; besides, they have been
much tried of late. A smart, dashing couple
have lately decamped, and left them with
vacant
rooms and an empty purse, after enjoying
their hospitality for some four months! The
gentleman was a sportsman, and two hounds
have likewise been kept at Mr. Durgin's
expense
;
both of which were sold yesterday at
public auction.
Sally hears a great deal from another
nursery
woman, who boards in the house: that
a keeper was put there a few days since,
because sundry articles of furniture are
unpaid
;
and well does this correspond with
Durgin's
continued application to Barclay to lend
him a few hundred.
Now, had Barclay been apprised of these
facts, nothing would have induced him to leave
Ingersoll's; but it is done; and were it not for
little Fanny's cough, he would not hesitate to
make another change.
Sally seldom spoke to Mr. Barclay; but
hearing him reason thus one evening, she
having
a strong inclination to leave herself,
suggested
that a change of air in the
hooping-cough
is often very salutary.
Mrs. Barclay now sits in a willing frame to
do just as is thought best; for, since her
children
have returned, and Fanny is sick, she
yearns after a home! She would even rejoice
could she but resume housekeeping, and thinks
no complaint of cares or ill health should
ever again pass her lips. It is to be supposed
I 2
that her husband understands this conflict in
her mind; but he is determined she shall fully
repent before a restoration takes place;
although
,
to secure this end, he is almost a
martyr
to the cause!
Mr. Barclay has engaged rooms at
Hotel. All his friends have told him that a
public house is far preferable to a private
one, because there is so much more
independence
in the former. But yesterday he met
Caleb, who informed him of a vacancy at the
above place; and, as an inducement that he
should secure it, remarked that he should
commence
boarding there himself to-morrow.
This was very agreeable intelligence to Mrs.
Barclay; for all the real fun she had known
since she left her own house had been
suggested
by Caleb's comical vein. Sally and
little Fan are put in a carriage; the latter
much wrapped in flannel, but still the cold air
gives the child a violent fit of coughing.
Indeed
,
Mrs. Barclay thinks she has pined, and
really feels very anxious, as she looks at her
lily face, after the suffusion has passed off
which coughing occasions. Arrived at their
new lodgings, Mr. Barclay commences going
up stairs. At the top of the first flight Mrs.
Barclay stops; but, no! higher yet; upup!
in fine, just sixty-five stairs above the
basement
story are her rooms! To be sure, they
are pleasant when once you reach them; they
are prettily furnished, and look more inviting
than any place she has seen since she left her
own house; but the little sick child still says,
Mamma, I want to go home. There is
something
peculiarly subduing in the tone of an
innocent
sufferer not quite four years old; and
Mrs. Barclay could only weep, as she too, like
the homesick little girl, wanted to go home.
But there are many pleasant things about
this establishment. Her first appearance at
the lady's ordinary was so unlike the
breakfast
at Mrs. Shortt's! Her husband, too, had
many business acquaintances, who, with their
families, found here what they termed a
comfortable
home, and Mrs. Barclay, of course,
was soon introduced to these ladies, and began
to feel once more as if she could move in
society
;
for, since she has been at board, no
single person has she met who has apparently
sympathized or cared for her save Caleb! He,
be it said in praise of his social friendly
feelings
,
has often cheered her hours of
despondency
.
Besides, he was a dear lover of play
with little Fan, and you may be assured
that her present feeble appearance is not
unnoticed
by him. He carries something to her
every day, and she now moans during his
absence
to see uncle Cale quite as much as her
father.
There is a great deal of social feeling carried
out in this establishment. The gentlemen often
give oyster suppers, and Champagne clubs are
very fashionable here, although two of the
boarders are temperance lecturers, and the
house is advertised as conducted on purely
temperance principles. But this only means,
to use Mr. Flash's expression, that liquors
are not furnished at the board. While the
gentlemen are thus regaling themselves at the
suppers, the ladies not unfrequently get up a
dance, and before the effervescence of the
Champagne has subsided, the gentlemen are
very nimble with their feet as well as tongues;
for an adjournment always takes place to the
ladies' sociable.
The worthy host, in addition to all these
parties
,
upon the first Monday of every month
makes all welcome to an elegant supper! Now,
to most people, this is a very unfit place to
find domestic happiness, in the old-fashioned
sense of the word. That term once meant a
private house, a few friends at one's fireside,
a rational talk, a simple repast, and a breaking
up by ten o'clock! Now it means hot suppers,
a great crowd, sparkling wines, cards, dancing,
a few unmeaning compliments, and a
separation
after midnight! The after-piece to the
former was a pleasant retrospect of the
evening
,
a closer bond of friendship, a clear head,
a desire for farther acquisition; that of the
latter is a bad headache, loss of appetite, a
blunting of social tenderness, an
ennul
which
makes us incapable of progress, and a distaste
for the sober realities of life. And yet many
people contrive to find a comfortable home
with a family of children in this independent
manner of living! But, alas! a day of
reckoning
comes, and fearful is the account!
To Hepsy Barclay this is a new life; but
something such a one as she once fancied she
should enjoy. The ladies of the house are
extremely
polite, and frequent interchanges of
little attentions are given and received. She
has already commenced taking lessons upon
the piano, and her teacher admits she has a
decided taste, although her husband much
doubts the fact. She dresses, too, with much
taste. The ornaments which were long useless
are displayed and admired; and Mrs. Bride
affirms that the Mechlin laces which always
adorn her handkerchiefs and collars are the
richest she ever saw. And she ought to know,
for did she not take the last of Plympton's lot
at twenty-five dollars a piece! It was a little
unkind, though, for Caleb to speak of Mr.
Bride's having just gone through bankruptcy!
And we may now inquire, why boarding after
this sort is not exactly in accordance with
Hepsy Barclay's preconceived opinion of real
happiness. She has nearly every thing
furnished
by simply asking for it; she has the
advantages
of genteel society; of excellent
fare either in her room or at the ordinary; is
in good health, and her cares are borne by
others. But she has a sick child, a couple of
roguish, truant boys, who will coast till a late
hour, and will keep asking their mother if
she don't mean to keep house again; and,
more than all, she has a husband, whose
clouded
brow and short stay with her betokens no
distant trouble. That near, familiar
intercourse
which Robert Barclay and his wife held
together, despite of her indifference, which
sometimes chilled him, has fled! It is only at
the festive board, after freely partaking of the
exhilarating draught, that he seems tolerably
cheerful! Poor woman, she imagines no one
knows this but herself, and she most
assiduously
sets herself to work to forget it! But
these are trials which all the combined forces
of attraction can not effectually exclude from
the mind's vision; they may be smothered in
the glare of day, in the giddy crowd, in the
evening gayety, but there is a night coming,
and with it, with redoubled energy, conscience
arouses and illusions vanish! Much as we
dread the terrible tribunal, we can not evade
it; let us thank a kind Providence that it is so.
It was a dark, stormy evening that Mrs.
Barclay
dressed herself for Mrs. Gale's evening
sociable! Fanny was ill, but the nurse
thought she was no worse than she had been;
and as she could do no good if she stayed
at home, and moped away the evening alone,
why should she do it? Besides, she was in
the house; it was very different from going in
a carriage at a distance.
Soon after her departure from the room
Barclay unexpectedly entered, bringing with
him his clerk, with a ponderous load of books
Sally proposed to call Mrs. Barclay; but no!
business was the order of the evening; and to
work in earnest went David and his master.
All at once Barclay threw down the account,
exclaiming, My God! I am undone! David,
put up the books; they look worse and worse.
Here is a labyrinth: this note of twenty-five
hundred, that of sixteen, and those other
liabilities
,
which amount to thousands!
Those other liabilities were unknown to
David
;
for the speculating mania in which
Barclay
had engaged to retrieve his fortune was
an enigma to David.
But, sir, said the clerk, perhaps you can
borrow these sums, and then a more favorable
issue may make money easier.
No, no! replied Barclay, I have too
much honor left to involve others by
borrowing
of them what I never can repay. No!
bad as it is, I will take advantage of the
bankrupt
act, and settle as best I may.
Mrs. Barclay returned about eleven. She
was really glad her husband had come home;
K
hoped he had not waited for her; and if he
had, why did he not step in Mrs. Gale's room?
they had a fine time, and Jerusha Long had
sung so exquisitely, and Susan Chase had
danced so magnificently; but, heavens! she
looked at Barclay, and he had fainted in his
chair! She throw open the adjoining door,
where Sally sat patting little Fanny's back, to
relieve and assist her coughing, and shrieked,
Sally! Sally! I believe Robert is dying!
With the aid of hartshorn, and cold water, and
friction, his reason, however, returned; and in
a few moments the tale was told: I am,
Hepsy, a ruined man!
This speech, accompanied by rapid strides
across the floor, really made Mrs. Barclay
shiver like an aspen leaf.
Whatwhat, she stammered, have you
done?
Lost a fortune like a fool! uttered
Barclay
;
and his very teeth chattered as he
spoke.
What a night was passed in that height of
despair, in that abode of luxury, in that place
of social festivity, in that chamber of death!
What strong contrasts this life often exhibits!
Who could help moralizing over this scene!
Barclay walked the floor the whole night with
the look of a maniac. No wonder his wife
threw off her jewels in disdain, and cast aside
her rich satin dress as of nothing worth; for,
in spite of all vanity and show, a husband's
failure and a dying child will subdue the
stoutest
heart!
The night, we have said, was one of agony;
but the morning came with a sadder scene!
Little Fanny is seized with the croup, and
life will be quickly extinct, if seasonable aid is
not speedily given! Caleb has gone for his
physician, who is a Homeopath; for he knows
one of his skill can give relief. Barclay has
run for a cordial at the apothecary's, which,
Sally says, is excellent; and, by this time,
many ladies in the house are sitting by the
little
sufferer's cradle. She moans out a
sentence
;
Mrs. Barclay's ear is put to its parched
mouth to catch it; she says, in almost
inaudible
words, I want to go home! Poor child!
would that thy mother could carry thee to thy
old nursery, for which thou hast so often pined;
but a better home awaits thee!
And did you never try the application of
cold water? inquires Mrs. Holden, a lady
boarder. I have known children saved in
the very last stages of croup by a plentiful
effusion
upon the chest of the patient.
I should not dare try it, says Mrs. Crane;
`Mrs. Kidder's cordial' is twice as good;
and thus, between them all, nothing is done
but an application of hot flannels to the
outside
of the throat; an experiment about as
useless
in a fit of the croup as to rub the back of
a child! But medicine has lost its power. Dr.
H has arrived, and informs Caleb the child
must die. And what a lesson is before us!
Barclay, who, an hour ago, was a lost man,
because he could not meet the payment of
some notes, and Mrs. Barclay, who was
fevered
with the excitement of the gay party, are
now awed into a silent agony by that
mysterious
messenger, who has taken but a little child!
Who can doubt but a merciful Providence thus
shows us how trifling are the hopes and
disappointments
which end in time, compared with
the revelations which may any moment await
us in eternity!

CHAPTER XII.
There
are periods in our existence when the
accumulated transgressions of years revive in
a moment, and overwhelm us with dismay.
Little Fanny is dead; and Barclay and his
wife, in speechless agony, sit beside her cradle.
Sally is gathering up the scattered toys with
which she last played, and sighing piteously
that her little charge is no more. She wets
her cold face, to preserve, if possible, her
natural
appearance; for Mr. Flash has gone for an
artist to take a miniature of the dead child.
There is a smile upon her mouth, and her
placid
features plainly indicate that she has got
home.
Sweet baby! exclaims the frantic mother,
how could I leave you to enjoy life away
from your presence?
Say not so, said the father. Hepsy, your
unfaithfulness only adds to my grief; for we
have both sinned against this lovely child, and
no wonder she is now taken from us. Have
I not a cup overflowing with sorrow? There
is no hope for me either here or hereafter,
reasoned the conscience-stricken man; for I
have been unfaithful to my duties for years.
No, husband, you have not, said the wife,
soothingly; you have ever been indulgent
and kind to me; and if you have been an
enemy
to any one, that was yourself.
Barclay's pent-up feelings now broke forth
afresh.
An enemy to myself? I was first one to
you, wife, then to my children, then to my
business, and always to myself. Had I but
remained in that little, humble shop, where I
first commenced business, and housekeeping
above it, in those low but pleasant apartments,
I should not have been disgraced by a failure!
Had I not been foolishly ambitious to secure a
large house, an expensive style of living, and to
incur great risks in business to support it, we
should not have been now at board! Had I
not been unnecessarily indulgent to you, that I
might secure your pleasure, I should not have
been so unfaithful to my parental relations!
And this, Hepsy, produces my greatest misery.
I date it far backto the first false step when
I left the simplicity in which I was educated
to be happy. But our little one is gone, and I
am a ruined man! were the incoherent, choked
sentences which often fell upon Mrs. Barclay's
ear.
In this suicidal frame of mindamid her
husband's ravingsthink you, kind reader, no
slumbering consciousness was awakened in her
heart, who could retrace every step of this
downward course to herself? Had she not
encouraged, perhaps first inspired the love of
style in her husband? Did she not complain,
years ago, of the disparity in which she was
held by her acquaintances, because she
inhabited
so cheap a house, even when he could
afford
to maintain a better style, as he was now
known as R. Barclay, commission-merchant?
And when she at length attained her hopes,
and removed into one of the most elegant,
commodious
,
and expensive houses in the city, and
men-servants and maid-servants came and
went at her bidding, did she not complain of
cares and trials, and fret out existence until
she left that home, and carried her purpose?
yes! the unwise purpose of boarding! And
when she and dear Cousin Fanny so long
sought for a place where she might find a home
free from all life's wearying cares, did she not
sometimes wish, yes, half wish, that the children
might be put away under the care of some
judicious
person, that she might have perfect ease
and liberty? And now one is removed! Her
heart acknowledged the justice of the decree.
But the artist has come, and with him Mr.
Flash, who most kindly offers every service
he can render to the afflicted parents.
Barclay's heart is softened, and he is
prompted
to take his friend Caleb aside and divulge
all his trials to him; so little do we know
what a change excessive sorrow will work in
us. But last night, in his confused and
agitated
state, the thought of revealing to Caleb
Flash what he is now about to do would have
been rejected with disdain. Bond possibly
might have been a private counselor; but no
other being on earth. Now he feels the
weakness
of his own strength; and Caleb, the
kindhearted
and facetious fellow-boarder, who is
always a favorite wherever he goes, has won
Barclay's confidence! He is just the person
to whom secrets may be safely intrusted; for
he has a whole soul, a large acquaintance with
the world, a ready smile or tear as the
occasion
suggests, and, on all proper occasions, as
we have seen, a flow of wit which never
wounds the most sensitive being; and, more
than all other weighty reasons why Barclay
should place confidence in him, he is a
temperance
man! Total abstinence is written upon
his countenance and advocated by his speech.
Barclay asks an interview at four o'clock in
the afternoon of this very day with Mr. Flash.
It takes place, and he discloses all his affairs.
To use Caleb's expression, when he came to
the sentence, and to-morrow I shall fail, it
went like a bowie-knife through his heart!
But then he saw commiseration was not the
language he must use; it should only be the
bright rays of hope, for despair seemed to have
gained the pre-eminence.
But the little child in the placid sleep of
death powerfully neutralized the proud heart
of Barclay, as it respected what the world
would say when his business should be
suspended
.
And who should perform the funeral
service? was the next question; and could the
corpse be removed below stairs when prayers
were offered? Barclay and his wife for some
months past had not attended public worship;
and Caleb suggested that his friend, the Rev.
Dr. P., should read the service of the
Episcopal
Church. But one objection was made:
Mrs. Barclay preferred that Mr. Milnor,
Fanny's
intended husband, should officiate; but, as
he was invited to be present, and Cousin Fanny
had already come to take a last look upon her
little namesake, the objection was overruled.
The day of the funeral was dark and rainy.
It was an occasion, however, of respectful
sympathy in the hotel. All Barclay's friends,
and the ladies who so lately had found in their
new acquaintance, Mrs. Barclay, a woman with
whom most were pleased, were present in the
long dining-room, where prayers were read.
Caleb seated himself between the two boys,
John and Charles Barclay, having
superintended
with Sally their suit of mourning. At
the close of the several petitions used in the
prayer-book for the burial of the dead, a
responsive
amen was audibly heard from a
female
voice! It came from the bishop's widow,
who boarded at Mrs. Shortt's with Barclay
and his wife. The good rector undoubtedly
waited upon his friend, little understanding
how haughtily she had aforetime conducted
herself as a fellow-boarder at Madame Shortt's!
But the funeral was soon over. Little Fanny
was placed in the receiving tomb, to be
conveyed
to that garden of graves (Mount
Auburn
)
as soon as the spring appears; and
Caleb
,
with his characteristic generosity, has
begged the privilege of erecting a little stone
there, simply inscribing upon it Fanny.
The death of this little child is of small
account
to the busy world; its funeral was
unheeded
by the passers by; it was no subject
over which we ought to mourn. But are we
not sometimes struck with what we term the
dark and mysterious ways of Providence,
which, in the end, produce light and clear the
path of duty? No event, therefore, is really
small whose results can be traced to such
momentous
issues!
The rumor that Barclay's notes were
protested
flew with electric speed through the
business community. It was not alone the
sufferers by the failure who felt an interest in
the event. Men talked of it who had long
known him; and some accounted for it in the
fact that his habits had changed of late; that
he had been a disappointed man in his
domestic
relations, and that oyster suppers
never added to the value of a man's credit
L
when they were washed away with the
exhilarating
glass! Others, too, had known of
his speculating propensity of late. One broker
had been heard to say he could tell of a
merchant
that was prodigiously sucked in when
fancy stocks were quoted at a downward
tendency. All these rumors gained strength
as they flew, and before night it was currently
reported that Robert Barclay had failed for
three hundred thousand; and some of the
knowing ones anticipated it from his
extravagances
,
bad habits, and extensive
speculation
in certain nameless stocks, which
may well be termed fancy until they assume
some fixed value.
Holman the lawyer had executed a deed
from Barclay to Bond within a month past,
conveying his dwelling-house to the latter; and
Mrs. Barclay had signed it just before she went
to the  Hotel to board. But as she
always
gave all property affairs into her
husband's
hands, she thought nothing of the
circumstance
.
These and other reports entirely
untrue were superadded to the list, and
Robert
Barclay was not a name in as good
repute
as formerly. But, although Barclay had
supposed much surprise would be the
consequence
of his failure, he had no suspicion that
the title of a speculator, or of a man who
had yielded to an appetite for strong drink,
had ever attached to him; for, in all his
lamentations
to his intimate friends, he carefully
suppressed what had now become the most
notorious part of his history, from the fact that
he was once so clear-headed, so excellent a
judge of all marketable goods in the
manufacturer's
line, and knew so well what varieties
would suit foreign markets! Is not this another
instance that those who use the glass too freely
suppose for a long time every body is ignorant
of the fact but themselves?
The day of the first development of one's
ruin to the world, in a business point of view,
is, perhaps, one of the most trying of our life.
There is, to be sure, the fearful looking for of
the days of anticipated calamity, and the
agonizing
nights, when every expedient is thought
over to avert it; but the day which actually
crushes the sensitive man, and makes him feel
as if his doom is sealed, is when his notes are
protested, and he stands forth in the community
as a bankrupt!
On the day of this announcement neither
Barclay
nor his wife was present at the ladies'
ordinary
.
Flash, it was currently rumored, was
in the secret of Barclay's affairs; and this piece
of information was afterward traced to Sally
the nursery woman, who overheard some
conversation
,
and communicated it to some of the
ladies in the house, who kindly invited her to
their rooms to inquire more particularly about
little Fanny's death and Mrs. Barclay's health!
Caleb, of course, was interrogated as if he
knew; but had they known him, it would have
suppressed all questionings at once. He
vindicated
his friends as far as a prudent man
could do so, and thus many mistakes were
corrected
,
which put a better face upon things;
for Barclay was not half as bad a man as he
was represented. Well did old Miss
Widdifield
afterward remark, Failures and deaths
lay a man's character bare.
And now the surmises began, that Barclay
might save a little fortune yet out of such
immense
liabilities; that he had an old head, and
had made a sudden crash; and not a few
suggested
,
were they his creditors, they should not
feel in a hurry to settle for fifty cents on a dollar!
Flash heard all these remarks in the world,
and they really gave him a renewed interest
in the man. He had already formed a plan
which he intended to propose to Barclay when
the nine days' wonder had ceased. But his
first work was to get him out as a man, and
make him hold up his head as such.
He was first seen at the table among the
fellow-boarders, and next in his counting-house.
It was in his heart fully to reform himself
from the day he left his little child in yonder
tomb! This determination, as soon as known,
invariably secures friends, and when it is
connected
with a transparent integrity and an
honest
L 2
surrender, creditors will not long remain
inexorable. But it is the work of time to
produce
restoration to one's character and fortune.
Let us hear some of Barclay's reasoning with
his friend Flash.
I intend, he says, to be an honest man;
to suppress nothing; for, since the affair is
known, I really feel better. There is a relief
when the Rubicon is passed. Now I can give
a bow and a cordial shake of the hand to my
next-door neighbors, assured of their sympathy,
if I but act as a man; and, to do this, I am
aware that I must immediately reduce my style
of living; this luxurious table and high board
ill comport with my circumstances; and,
besides
,
it is no place to educate boys like mine.
I know it all, said Caleb; but already at
our table I count more than a dozen bankrupts,
who are safely ashore on the continent of
contentment
.
I only speak of this, because they
are so apt to comment upon others, who have
more recently than themselves got aground, as
old Ingersoll used to say.
That evening our friends met again in
Barclay's
parlor. Caleb desired Mrs. Barclay's
presence, and Cousin Fanny's, if she wished to
hear some good news. It had been so long
since cheerfulness had been upon Mr. Barclay's
brow, that now it seemed as if it gave him a
new attraction.
As I was in my office to-day, resumed
Caleb, a gentleman entered, who is a large
shareholder in a certain corporation, whose
credit exceeds that of any bank. He inquired
of me if I knew a man capable of being
over-seer
in a large cotton-mill. I asked him the
qualifications. He replied, `Honesty,
temperance
,
and a business capacity are all the
requisites
.'
`And what salary?' `Twelve
hundred
a year,' was the reply, `and the use of a
house belonging to the corporation.' `Have
you good schools there?' `Yes, plenty of
them; academies, public schools, and private
ones.' `Is there good female society there?'
`Yes,' retorted my friend; `you can procure a
wife worth having any daya real domestic,
home-loving woman, Mr. Flash.' I told him,
then, I knew such a man; for my mind at once
reverted to you, Mr. Barclay; and shall I
secure
such a place for you? It must be
decided
to-morrow, and the services will commence
April first.
Gratitude is a poor word in return for such
a favor, replied Barclay; and Mrs. Barclay
wiped a tear as she uttered a feeble but
heartfelt
I'm sure it is, Mr. Flash.
I shall only regret your presence, said
Barclay, in our midst; but as the cars can
convey you to our door (for, it seems, Barclay
knew the very spot), we shall not feel that
we have lost you as a neighbor.
The day after this unexpected good fortune
was fixed for Cousin Fanny's wedding-day!
It was a simple service, performed at her own
home; and Caleb, still a generous,
kind-hearted
soul, accepted an invitation, procured a
carriage
,
and took with him Mr. and Mrs.
Barclay
,
and the two boys.
Fanny Milnor has long since repented
that she ever suggested to Hepsy Barclay the
plan of boarding out; for she has learned,
better than ever, to urge a woman to pursue a
course so directly opposed to her husband's
wishes; but she often quotes the line from her
favorite author Pope,
From seeming evil still educing good.
Not long since, Caleb and Mr. and Mrs.
Milnor met at Mr. Barclay's residence at
L. Barclay had just returned from the
city, where he had effected a settlement with
one of his most uncompromising creditors. It
was a happy meeting. Temperance, order,
and domestic peace seemed to have made
their abode in this dwelling; and old Polly is
once more returned to her former master and
mistress, because her health demanded her to
leave the city. Mrs. Barclay never
complains
of her cares in housekeeping; she
has, however, dispensed with Sally, the
nursery
woman. John and Charles go to the
academy
,
and are promising boys; and if ever a
murmur is heard in the family, it is
instantly
checked, as Mrs. Barclay is reminded of
Boarding Out!
THE END.Boston,
December 20th,
Dear Fanny
,
Our plans are all arranged. Little did I
think, when we conversed together upon the
subject of my giving up housekeeping, I should
so soon carry into effect your plan. I call it
yours, for you first suggested to me the
expedient
of ridding myself of domestic trials. Mr.
Barclay was at first wholly averse to hearing
a word about it; but, dear Fanny, I talked
hours, yes! days, until he yielded! Was he
not a kind husband? I never suggested to him
that you were prime mover, lest in future time,
if things should not turn out well, you might
be reproached. But, cousin, I am wholly
unacquainted
with the process of `breaking up
housekeeping.' I thought we should never get
furnished when we moved here; and now I
feel as if we never should get things in order
for the sale, unless you come immediately and
help me. You will therefore stand by me for
at least three or four weeks; help me look out
a boarding-house, &c. Come in the four o'clock
omnibus this afternoon. Truly,
H.
Barclay
.D, Feb. 12th,.
Cousin Hepsy
,
I was just at my writing-desk, dictating a
note to be sent to you, as your kind one
arrived
.
Do not think me, Cousin Hepsy, a
maniac, ranting in an untrue style, when I tell
you I had accepted an invitation to stand as
bridemaid to Madam Shortt the very day the
announcement of her marriage was made to
you! My partner (for I will tell the whole)
is Rev. Mr. Milnor, our former clergyman, now
of your city, who knew Colonel Bumblefoot
many years in England, and many since in
America; and, at his urgent request, has
consented
to stand nearest him during the
ceremony
!
But your exclamations are not over
yet. I suppose, at no very distant day, your
cousin, Fanny Jones, may sign her name as
`Fanny Milnor!' You will please
communicate
this to your good husband; and if I can
be of any service to you again in a chase for
a boarding-house, you are welcome to my
services
.
As ever,
Fanny
.
